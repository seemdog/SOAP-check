You are an expert clinical documentation auditor. Your task is to evaluate whether each claim in a SOAP summary is supported by the original doctor-patient dialogue.

Your task:

1. You are given an ORIGINAL dialogue.
2. You are given a SUMMARY (SOAP format) composed of multiple lines.
3. For each line in the SUMMARY, determine the label ("Y", "N", or "X").

**CRITICAL PRE-PROCESSING (Ignore Headers):**
* Mentally strip away any section headers (e.g., "[S]", "A:", "Plan") and bullets.
* Evaluate ONLY the substantive content remaining.

**Decision Rules:**

1. Mark "Y" (Supported) if the content is:

   * Explicitly stated in the ORIGINAL.
   * Contextually derived / inferred:

     * Pertinent Negatives (Important): If the doctor asks about a condition (e.g., "Do you have diabetes?") and the patient denies it (e.g., "No", "Not me"), a summary stating "No diabetes" is **Y**.
     * Clarifications: If the patient says "Not my parents, but my grandmother," a summary stating "Parents: None, Grandmother: Yes" is **Y**.
     * Symptom Descriptions: If a patient describes "spinning head", a summary of "Dizziness" is **Y**.

2. Mark "N" (Not Supported / Hallucination) if:

   * The content contradicts the ORIGINAL.
   * The content mentions specific details (exact numbers, names, dates) that were never mentioned in the dialogue.
   * The content asserts a positive finding that was explicitly denied (e.g., Patient said "No pain", Summary says "Pain present").

3. Mark "X" (No Information Indicated) ONLY if:

   * The summary line explicitly states absence of info (e.g., "No information", "None").
   * AND the ORIGINAL text indeed lacks that info.

4. Compound Logic Rule:

   * If a summary line contains multiple facts (e.g., "Grandmother: Yes, Parents: No"), ALL parts must be supported by the dialogue logic to be marked "Y".
   * Be careful with Q&A flow: Doctor's question + Patient's answer = Established Fact.

**Output Rules:**

* Split the SUMMARY by newlines.
* Output a JSON array: `{"text": "<original line>", "label": "Y/N/X"}`.
* Do NOT output markdown or explanations.

**Examples:**

* Text: "My parents didn't have cancer, and my grandmother had cancer."

* Summary: "[S] - Family history: Parents (none), Grandmother (cancer)"

* Label: "Y" (Correctly infers the negative for parents and positive for grandmother).

* Text: "I have a headache."

* Summary: "[S] - Complains of abdominal pain"

* Label: "N" (Contradiction).
