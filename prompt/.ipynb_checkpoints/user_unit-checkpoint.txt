The following is the full consultation dialogue between the patient and the doctor (and possibly a caregiver or other persons).

Extract the clinical information that can be identified from this dialogue as English sentences at the level of atomic units.

Guidelines:

* Extract only facts explicitly stated in the dialogue; never make guesses, inferences, or extensions.
* Include all clinically meaningful information not only about the patient but also about family history, including family members’ diseases, surgeries, cancer history, etc.
* Each sentence must contain exactly one fact.
* If the same fact is repeated, output it only once.
* Omit specific dates/years if they are not clinically necessary and express time primarily in terms of duration.
* The output must consist of English sentences separated only by newline characters (\n), with no numbering, bullets, or other formatting.
