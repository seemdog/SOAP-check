The following is the summary.

[Summary]
{SUMMARY_TEXT}

According to the above guidelines, compare the concepts that appear in each of the S/O/A/P sections and identify any duplicated concepts.

Summary of conditions to apply:

* Judge duplication within the same section very conservatively;
  simply repeating the same word does **not** count as duplication.
* If the same concept plays a semantically different role (e.g., past history vs treatment context), do **not** treat it as a duplicate.
* If a concept appears in S as a chief complaint (symptom) and in A as something like “suspected ~”, “possible ~”, “rule out ~”, “needs differential diagnosis”, etc., do **not** treat it as a duplicate.
* If the same concept is truly repeated separately within a single section, the value should be in the form `["Section"]`.
* If the same concept appears in multiple different sections, include all such sections in the list.

The output must be valid JSON.

* If there are duplicates, for example:
  {
  "concept1": ["S", "A"],
  "concept2": ["S"]
  }
* If there are no duplicates at all:
  {}

Do not output any additional explanations, natural language sentences, or meta text.
Output only the JSON.
