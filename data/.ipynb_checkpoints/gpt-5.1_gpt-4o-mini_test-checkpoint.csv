[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] to about eight centimeters . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard in the past . and , on your lung exam , i do appreciate some fine crackles at the bases bilaterally , and your lower extremities have , you know , 1+ pitting edema . so , what does all that mean ? that means i think you're retaining a little bit of fluid .

[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] does that sound like a plan ?

[patient] and uh ... i-i think i need to go clean for a couple of weeks . but other than that , it was been- it's been pretty good eating .
[doctor] okay , all right . and how about your high blood pressure ? are you monitoring your blood pressure readings at home , like i recommended ?
[patient] i'm good about it during the week while i am at home working, but on the weekends when i'm out of the house i tend to forget . uh , and so it's not as regimented , but it's been pretty good and-and under control for the most part .
[doctor] okay , and you're you're taking your medication ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] okay . and then lastly , i know that you had had some early arthritis in your knee . how- how are you doing with that ?
[patient] uh ... it gets aggravated every once in a while . if i- maybe if i run too much or if i've lift boxes that are a little too heavy , i start to feel the strain . but it's been okay . not great , but it's been okay .

[patient] no .

[doctor] on your heart exam . which you've had in the past .
[patient] mm-hmm .

[patient] i ... i'm pretty regular with the medications during the business week , but on there's weekends , you know , if i'm on the fly or doing something , sometimes i forget , or i forget to bring it with me . uh , but for the most part , it's been okay .

[patient] other than during the heat and the pollen , it's been pretty good .

[patient] sometimes i , i regularly , uh , go for a run in the morning . that's my workout , and sometimes if it's , uh , relatively humid , i'll struggle a little bit , and i might feel a little bit of pounding in my chest . it usually goes away , but , uh , again , for the most part , it's been pretty good .
[doctor] okay , so you also have some shortness of breath with with exertion .
[patient] correct . correct .
[doctor] all right , and how far are you running ?

virtscribe_D2N073_nan,"[doctor] today i'm seeing christina cooper . her date of birth is 07/01/1954 . uh , ms. cooper is a new patient who was referred by diane nelson for a long-standing iron deficiency anemia .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] so tell me what brings you in today .
[patient] recently i tried to donate blood , around december i think , and they told me i was anemic , which is something i've been dealing with for a while , so it's not the first time i've been told i'm anemic .
[doctor] or how have you been feeling in general with this ?
[patient] not great . i have been feeling fatigued often during the day , and even feverish with chills at times . when i try to be active i like i ca n't catch my breath and i feel like i'm wheezing . i've had some headaches too , which is not like me .
[doctor] okay . are there any other symptoms ?
[patient] i've been noting some chilling sensations . i also get cold so easily . it's annoying . i feel like i have to really bundle up . i do n't know if this is related but my anxiety and depression feel like it has been getting worse lately . i feel like a mess .
[doctor] sounds like you're not feeling great , obviously . and i'm glad you came to see us . um , we're certainly going to try to figure this out and figure out what's going on , uh , but it sounds like you've been dealing with this anemia for a long time ?
[patient] yeah , i've been anemic since i was 13 years old .
[doctor] right . so why do your doctors think you're anemic ? do you have a history of heavy periods ?
[patient] well i did have heavy periods until i had a hysterectomy in 1996 . but no , they have not told me why they think i'm anemic , which is frustrating honestly .
[doctor] yeah . i can imagine that is . um , let's see if we can help though . since you had your hysterectomy your periods , of course , are no longer the issue . um , when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] about five to six years ago .
[doctor] and was it relatively a normal exam ? did you have any polyps ?
[patient] no . they said they'd see me in 10 years .
[doctor] well that's good news .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] um , do you have a pacemaker or defibrillator , or have sleep apnea , or use oxygen at night ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . do you ever drink alcohol ?
[patient] yeah , but only once or twice a year .
[doctor] okay . are you taking any supplements such as iron or vitamin b12 ?
[patient] i already started taking my iron pills which i have not taken in about a year .
[doctor] all right . and what are you taking ?
[patient] i'm taking 25 milligram tablets , twice daily .
[doctor] okay , and that's the , the ferrous sulfate ?
[patient] yeah , that's it . i take one in the morning and one in the evening .
[doctor] okay . anything else ?
[patient] yeah , i take vitamin b12 , just the over the counter stuff .
[doctor] okay , very good . all right , well let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .
[patient] sounds good . thank you .
[doctor] of course . you'll hear me , uh , talk through your exam so that i get all the information documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so use my general physical exam template . i will start by listening to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . next , i'd like you to lay back so i can examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is there any tenderness where i'm pressing ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . you can sit up . so your physical exam is normal without any significant findings . all right ms. cooper , often when we initially see anemia and your host of symptoms , we suspect internal bleeding .
[patient] is that why they want me to have another upper endoscopy ?
[doctor] actually it would be an upper endoscopy and a colonoscopy , but yes , likely that's the reason why .
[patient] lovely .
[doctor] yeah . unfortunately our cameras do not meet all the way in the middle , so if those tests back , come , if those tests come back fine , then we'll have you swallow a pill camera to take pictures as it moves through your , uh , system .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] we may not need to , but it's just the first thing we can do to make sure that you're not losing blood . um , the second thing we can do is have you see a hematologist . they will tell us if you need to give any , to give you any intravenous iron , or maybe something to help your body store the iron better .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's go ahead , get your upper endoscopy and colonoscopy scheduled .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , have you ever had any issue with sedation in the past ?
[patient] no , i was just sleepy afterwards .
[doctor] okay . well we will give you a bowel prep to clean out your bowels ahead of time . um , if we do these tests and they are normal , like i said , then we will consider that capsule endoscopy .
[patient] okay . sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right . so after that you'll be all done and we will send you to the hematologist . additionally , i'm going to need you to start taking your iron pills with orange juice . uh , the vitamin c will help you absorb the iron better . do this for about 8-12 weeks , uh , and then we can reassess your blood work .
[patient] okay , that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . well i think we have our plan . on your way out , stop by and schedule your upper endoscopy and c- colonoscopy . uh , we will send a referral to dr. flores who is is the hematologist , so schedule that appointment . um , here are your instructions for the pre- uh , the bowel prep . uh , call us if you have any questions or worsening symptoms . we'll be happy to help you .

[doctor] all right . the patient is alert , oriented to time , place , and person . affect is appropriate and speech is fluent . cranial nerve examination is grossly intact . no focal , motor , or sensory deficit in the upper or lower extremities . visual acuity and eye movements are normal . pupils are equal and reactive . visual field testing reveals bitemporal hemianopia . and color vision is normal .
[doctor] all right , mr. ward . i'm going to review these pictures from the mri with you . um , now this appears to be a benign pituitary adenoma , but there's no way to be sure without sending the removed adenoma to pathology to make the diagnosis , which we will do . um , here you can see it's a well defined mass . and it's pressing right here on what we call the optic chiasm . and today when i was having you look at my fingers , you could n't see them off to the sides , that's what we call bitemporal hemianopia . and explains why you have been bumping into door frames .
[patient] yeah i never noticed that i could n't see out of the side until you did that test , and you closed one eye with both eyes . i really could n't tell .
[doctor] no because you're having this vision loss from the mass compressing the optic chiasm , the only option we have is to do surgery .
[patient] okay , i understand . do you think i'll regain my vision ?
[doctor] well there's no guarantees , but it is a possibility . i'm gon na refer you to the eye doctor for a full exam and they'll do what's called visual field test . this will map our your peripheral vision or side vision prior to surgery . and we can monitor after surgery to see if your vision is improving .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] and let's discuss the surgery a little more . um , we would do what's called a transsphenoidal approach to do the surgery . this is minimally invasive and we go through the sphenoid sinus . there are some risks i have to inform you of . uh , risk of anesthesia including but not limited to the risk of heart attack , stroke , and death . risk of surgery include infection , need for further surgery , wound issues such as spinal fluid leak or infection , uh , which may require long , prolonged hospitalization or additional procedure . uh , seizure , stroke , permanent numbness , weakness , difficulty speaking , or even death .
[patient] well i guess we have to do it regardless .
[doctor] okay . so i will have you see our surgery scheduler , deborah , on the way out to get you set up . we will get this scheduled fairly quickly so i do n't want you to be alarmed . um , she'll also get you set up today or tomorrow to have the visual field test and you may not be able to see the eye doctor until after surgery . but we have the pre-surgery visual field test for comparison after surgery .
[patient] okay . i look forward to these headaches going away . i never thought it could be something like this going on .
[doctor] yeah . come this way , we'll get your things lined up . please call if you think of any questions .
[patient] thanks , doctor .
[doctor] diagnosis will be pituitary adenoma . mr . ward is a very pleasant 52-year-old male who has benign appearing pituitary adenoma , incidentally discovered during workup for worsening headaches . he is symptomatic with clinical and radiographical evidence of optic chiasmal compression , therefor surgical intervention to excise and decompress the pituitary fossa is indicated . end of note .","S (Subjective):

[patient] good morning . yes . that's me .
[doctor] hey , i'm dr. sanders . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you too .
[doctor] so tell me about what brings you in today ?
[patient] well , i really needed to see you three months ... three months ago , but this was your first available appointment . when i called to make the appointment , i was having chest pains , but it stopped after four days , and i have n't had any since then .
[doctor] okay . when did these four days of chest pain occur ?
[patient] um , early october .
[doctor] of 2020 , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . can you think of anything that might have caused the chest pain ? did you wake up with it ?
[patient] no . it just it randomly . i tolerated it for four days but then had to go to the emergency room because nothing i did relieved it . they did a bunch of testing and did n't find anything .
[doctor] okay . can you point to the area of your chest where the pain was located ?
[patient] well , it was here in the center of my chest , right behind my breastbone . it felt like i was having a heart attack . the pain was really sharp .
[doctor] did they prescribe you any medications in the er ?
[patient] no . they ran an ekg and did blood tests , but like i said , everything was normal .
[doctor] okay . i see .
[patient] they thought it was something to do with the gi system , so that's why they referred me here .
[doctor] interesting . uh , do you remember having any heartburn or indigestion at , at the time ?
[patient] uh , maybe . i do n't think i've ever had heartburn , so i'm not sure what that feels like .
[doctor] was the pain worse with eating or exercise ?
[patient] yes . with eating .
[doctor] okay . any difficulty swallowing ?
[patient] mm-hmm . i did .
[doctor] okay . and that's also resolved since the initial episode three months ago ?
[patient] yes . thankfully . the chest pain and swallowing problem got better about three days after i went to the er . but i just feel like there's something wrong .
[doctor] okay . so how has your weight been .
[patient] i've been trying to lose weight .
[doctor] that's good . any in- ... issues with abdominal pain ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . good . and how about your bowel movements ; are they okay ?
[patient] they're normal .
[doctor] all right . are you aware of any family history of gi problems ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] have had you had any surgeries on your abdomen , or gall bladder , or appendix ?
[patient] yes . they took my gall bladder out several years ago .
[doctor] okay . if you wan na lay down here on the table for me and lets take a look at you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so when i push on your lower belly , do you have any pain , or does it feel tender ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . how about up here in your upper abdomen ?
[patient] yes . it , it hurts a little .
[doctor] okay . and even when i press lightly like this ?
[patient] yes . uh , just a little uncomfortable .
[doctor] okay . does it hurt more when i press over here on the left or over here on the right ? or is it about the same ?
[patient] i'd say it's about the same .
[doctor] okay . so we'll say you have some mild tenderness to light palpation in the upper abdominal quadrants , but everything on your exam looks normal and looks good .
[patient] okay . good .
[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously , with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues , but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er . um , other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus . but typically with these , um ... but typically , these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had . um , it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days .
[patient] well , since you mention anxiety , i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time this happened .
[doctor] okay . that's good to know . so stress from this could be , um ... could be , uh ... could be very well have contributed to your condition .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so we could do an , uh , egd or upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis . but your symptoms occurred three months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes , so likely if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point ... by this point , and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor , uh , for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd . uh , with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option . but what do you think ?
[patient] i'd like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms .
[doctor] that sounds good . um , so you can call the office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we'll get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow up with me ... follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right ? if you do n't have any questions for me , i'll walk you out to the check-out desk .
[patient] no . that's it . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . right this way . all right . uh , in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly , and let's list her possible etiologies such as , uh , gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety . uh , suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition , plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies . um , in the plan , include our discussion of the egd versus monderning ... monitoring for symptom . patient elected to self-monitor her symptoms and will call with any reoccurrence or change . thanks .","S (Subjective):

[patient_guest] hi .
[doctor] i'm dr. evelyn , one of the kidney doctors . it's good to meet you guys .
[patient_guest] it's nice to meet you also .
[doctor] yeah . so i was reading about this syndrome that i actually have never heard of .
[patient_guest] yeah , me too .
[doctor] i do n't think it's very common .
[patient_guest] definitely not . it's c- pretty rare .
[doctor] so-
[doctor] can you start at the beginning ? i know she's a twin , so are these your first two babies ?
[patient_guest] no , i have a son also who is nine . he also has autism .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and when the twins were born , katherine , she was about 4 pounds , 8 ounces . and her twin was a bit smaller , at 3 pounds , 13 ounces .
[patient_guest] katherine , she was doing fine . she just had problems with eating , where she would stop breathing when she was eating .
[doctor] like preemie type stuff ?
[patient_guest] uh- . yeah . she just had a hard time regulating her temperature , but she did fine . she does have a gi doctor , because she has reflex really bad . she also had a dietician , who told us to take her off cow's milk . which we did . and then she has seen an allergist , and also a neurologist ... who diagnosed her with this syndrome , because she still does n't walk and she was n't sitting by herself a year old .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient_guest] but so now she is crawling and she is trying to take steps , so think she's doing pretty good .
[doctor] good . is she in therapy ?
[patient_guest] she is in therapy . she's in feeding therapy , occupational therapy , and also physical therapy .
[doctor] awesome . okay .
[patient_guest] and we also have speech therapy , who is going to be starting within the next couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient_guest] so , she has a lot of therapies . we have also seen an orthopedic and an ophthalmologist . i can never say that . we have seen everything , really .
[doctor] and audiology too , right ?
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] yeah , wow. .
[patient_guest] yeah , it has definitely been a whirlwind of stuff . when we saw the geneticist , she told us that sometimes people with this syndrome , they have trouble with their kidneys . that they might actually fuse into one . she also said sometimes they have problems with their legs , so that was why we saw ortho .
[doctor] okay . okay .
[patient_guest] so we have seen everybody , really . we are just here to make sure that her kidneys are looking good right now .
[doctor] yeah , okay . so , um , tell me about how many wet diapers she has in a 24 hour period ?
[patient_guest] she has a lot .
[doctor] so like normal 8 to 10 , or like 20 ?
[patient_guest] yeah , it's around 8 to 10 .
[doctor] okay . great .
[patient_guest] yeah , she seems to pee a lot , and it feels like she drinks a lot too .
[doctor] that's perfect .
[patient_guest] and she used to only drink milk , and then i took her off dairy milk . so when i say milk , i actually mean , you know , ripple pea protein milk .
[doctor] sure , yeah .
[patient_guest] so i give her that milk , water now that she's used to it , and sometimes water with just a little bit of juice . so i do feel like she's drinking a lot better now .
[doctor] that's great . and she's how old now ?
[patient_guest] she'll be two mo- two next month .
[doctor] okay . is her twin a boy or a girl ?
[patient_guest] she's a girl .
[doctor] okay , and how's she doing ?
[patient_guest] she's doing really good . she's running around , and she does n't have any problems .
[doctor] all right . is she bigger than her or the same size ?
[patient_guest] they're about the same size . they're able to wear the same clothes , so ...
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] i do n't even think she's a pound hav- heavier , actually .
[doctor] yeah . yeah .
[patient_guest] but she is a little bit taller than her ... um , katherine . she's just sh- a little shorter and chunkier , but i think that's a part of her syndrome .
[doctor] yeah . yeah , i was reading all the things associated with the syndrome . it sounds like we're looking for continual- congenital anomalies wi- of the kidney and urinary tract . which is basically something is wrong with the plumbing .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] so the only way to know that , is to do a kidney ultrasound .
[patient_guest] okay , that sounds okay .
[doctor] okay . let me put that into the system , and then downstairs they can do the ultrasound .
[patient_guest] all right , thank you .
[doctor] okay , yeah . where do you all live ?
[patient_guest] uh , we live in dallas .
[doctor] okay . anybody in the family with kidney failure , dialysis or transplant ?
[patient_guest] no .
[doctor] okay . so let's get your ultrasound done , and we'll see how it goes .
[patient_guest] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] all right . let me take a quick look at her .
[patient_guest] sure .
[doctor] all right . please use my physical exam template . um , i wan na take a quick listen to her heart and lungs . i'll look in her ears too . and she can sit , she can just sit on your lap .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right . that's it .
[patient_guest] all right , that was n't too bad .

[doctor] okay so you know looking at your looking at your head and your neck i do n't appreciate any like adenopathy no thyromegaly no no carotid bruit looking at your listening to your heart i do n't appreciate any murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally your lower legs you have palpable pulses no lower edema your shoulders every like your upper extremities i see normal range of movement with your right wrist let's go ahead and focus on it so when i push on the inside here does it hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] it does
[doctor] and what about the outside does that hurt as well
[patient] yeah it does
[doctor] are you able to move your wrist towards your arm like
[patient] not without extreme pain
[doctor] okay so pain on flexion what about extension when you pick your wrist up
[patient] yeah i have a hard time doing that actually
[doctor] alright what about we're gon na go ahead and hold your arm like straight like flat and then try and move it sideways does radial deviation hurt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright and then lateral as well
[patient] yeah it's really hard to move any direction of this hand for some reason
[doctor] alright so wrist abduction adduction positive for pain on movement are you able to make a fist
[patient] hmmm yeah a little bit but i ca n't do it really tight
[doctor] okay alright okay so i'm just gon na go ahead and feel on your fingers really quickly alright metacarpals intact noticed some obvious swelling ecchymosis obvious swelling and bruising tenderness on palpation throughout there is evidence of potential fracture feeling some bony crepitus alright so this pain is it like chronic i wanted to ask you
[patient] yeah i would say it kinda goes away when i take that ibuprofen but for the most part i feel it i feel it there and it it's just really really bad when i move it all
[doctor] okay so when you like is there a position either hurts less or hurts more like say if your arm is raised and elevated over your head does it hurt more or is it just best to keep it like down
[patient] it's good if i keep it a little bit above my like a little i guess a little bit like around my like just a regular level like if you're typing or something and then i just put it on a pillow and i just let it stay straight like i feel better
[doctor] okay yeah no i do n't think i understand completely okay so i took a look at your vitals and your blood pressure is a little elevated but honestly that's probably to do with the pain right our body can respond to pain in that way we are looking at like a hundred and forty over over seventy it's not anything crazy but something to mention i see that your heart rate is also a little elevated at like about like eighty beats a minute you are not running a fever so that's great look at ninety ninety seven . two your respiratory rate is pretty normal at like twenty so before we came in i i know that we had you do an x-ray and i'm sure that that was a bit more painful because we had to do so many manipulations but i do wan na note that you are positive for what we call a colles' fracture what that means is that the joints between your wrist like the bones between your wrist that there there is evidence of a a fracture and we are gon na have to treat it a little conservatively at first and then consider some of the options options that are available to us so for your primary diagnosis of a colles' fracture we are going to give you a thumb spica for today and that's going to
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] pardon what
[patient] a what
[doctor] we're gon na brace you we're gon na give you a brace
[patient] okay thank you
[doctor] sorry no problem sorry yeah not a thumb spica we're gon na brace your arm and you're gon na have that we we have a couple of options but i think the best course of action is gon na be for surgery we will in the meantime give you pain medication i wan na put you on fifty milligrams of ultram every six hours and then i also wan na get you on get you into physical therapy a few weeks after surgery this is gon na be just a normal procedure you will be in for an overnight stay but after that once we assess and make sure that everything is good you'll be able to go home okay
[patient] when do i have to have the surgery
[doctor] we would like it to happen as quickly as possible you know your body is a wonderful miracle and it's going to start trying to heal on it's own what we need to do is get your wrist straight and then like put screws in to make sure that we hold it in place or else it could like heal and malform
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so what
[patient] how how long do i have to wear that brace
[doctor] you're gon na be wearing the brace for about six weeks
[patient] six weeks
[doctor] yeah so you're gon na you're gon na come in for your surgery we're gon na perform it you're gon na stay overnight and then you'll be bracing it for six weeks in the meantime you'll also then go to physical therapy i want you there like we're gon na they're gon na do an assessment and determine how much but i'm thinking probably three times a week just to make sure that you can get your wrist as strong as possible to prevent like future injury now the cool thing about getting any kind of a bone break is that your your body comes out even stronger so this should n't happen again but unfortunately like it's these situations that oof that just kind of
[patient] oof
[doctor] these these deform these deformities that really that really kind of hurt is the short version alright no problem any other questions
[patient] no well i am going on vacation do i need to cancel it like can i still go even with the i mean after the surgery
[doctor] yeah
[patient] do it as soon as possible i'm going a vacation in a month so
[doctor] okay how long is the vacation
[patient] it's only for like a couple weeks
[doctor] okay well so you might have to postpone it just because depending on what physical therapy says right if they feel that you can sustain if you can like sustain the exercises while you're gone that if there's something that you can do by yourself then you should be fine but we do wan na give it you said that it's gon na happen in a couple of weeks
[patient] no vacation in a month
[doctor] okay okay yeah so how about in a month we come you come back let's do a checkup again see where we are at and then we can assess whether or not this is something that i would recommend you do
[patient] that sounds good thank you
[doctor] no problem bye

[patient] yes i have
[doctor] okay so you might have a little white coat syndrome i know some of my patients definitely do have that so what about your diet i know we talked a little bit before about you reducing your sodium intake to about twenty three hundred milligrams per per day i know you were during the pandemic your diet got out of little bit out of control so how have you been doing how have you been doing with that
[patient] i definitely need some help there i have not have not made some some changes
[doctor] okay yeah we definitely need to get you to lower that salt intake get your diet a little bit better because the hope is to get you off that medication and get your blood pressure to a manageable level okay so we yeah we definitely can talk about that alright so lem me take a look at your knee i'll do a quick physical exam on you and before i do just want to make sure you're not having any chest pain today

[patient] i'm doing okay aside from this left shoulder pain that i've been having
[doctor] okay and how long have you had this pain
[patient] about i want to say a few weeks i think it's been about three weeks now
[doctor] okay and do you remember what you were doing when the pain started
[patient] honestly i've been trying to recall if i had any specific injury and i ca n't think of that
[doctor] okay
[patient] of anything the only thing i can think of is that i you know i am active and we've just been doing a lot of work in our basement so if i do n't know if i did something while doing that
[doctor] okay alright tell me have you ever had pain in that shoulder before
[patient] you know i i'm really active and so i i will get some aches and pains here and there but nothing that tylenol ca n't take care of
[doctor] okay good but now are you able to move your arm
[patient] you know i have trouble when i'm trying to reach for something or lift any objects and i do n't even try to reach it for anything over my head because then it'll really hurt
[doctor] okay alright and and now are you having the pain all the time or does it come and go
[patient] the pain is always there and then it gets worse like if i try to put any pressure on it it gets worse so if i'm laying at night if i try to even lay on that shoulder it's unbearable
[doctor] okay and then tell me what have you taken for your pain
[patient] i've been taking two extra strength tylenol every six to eight hours
[doctor] alright and and did that help
[patient] it does take the edge off but i still have some pain
[doctor] okay well i'm sorry to hear that you know you know renovating the basement it can be quite a task and it can take a toll on you
[patient] yeah i mean it's been fun but yeah i think it really did take a toll on me
[doctor] yeah what what are you doing with your basement are you are you doing like a a man cave or
[patient] yeah yeah that's exactly right

[doctor] now i'm also going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and during that time you may also continue to take tylenol now if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection for your shoulder which can provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan at all
[patient] so do you think this pain will ever go away
[doctor] now well many patients are very successful with the physical therapy those will those help strengthen you know they do a lot of strengthening exercises with you to help strengthen you know your muscles so that it's not your movements not always relying on those joints predominantly so we're gon na go ahead and start with that and then see how you do okay

[doctor] okay yeah that sounds like a good idea have you thought about even having a a cane just in case or do you think that's does that happen often enough
[patient] wrap it i would n't be able to keep track of it so no no pain
[doctor] okay okay well so since you're in how about your blood pressure how how is it doing and have you been taking your blood pressures at home like we talked about
[patient] yes they are doing fine still about the same
[doctor] so
[patient] correct that whatever

[patient] i ca n't really remember it's been several days since i took it but i think it runs around one twenty over seventy somewhere along in there
[doctor] okay alright and so what about your medication we have you on some medication for your blood pressure right
[patient] yes i take take them regularly at eight thirty in the morning and eight thirty at night
[doctor] and what is the medication and the dosage that you are taking
[patient] i'm taking a farxiga and amlodipine
[doctor] okay
[patient] and lisinopril and the hydrochlorothiazide so i i ca n't pronounce that one so but those are all small dosage pills
[doctor] that but yeah go ahead
[patient] no that was it i just take them regularly eight thirty in the morning eight thirty at night
[doctor] yeah well that's good i i know you said you set an alarm on your phone to make sure that you get them taken at the right time so that's really good and how are your blood sugars doing how is your diet doing
[patient] my blood sugar has been running a little higher at about one thirty
[doctor] is that in the morning when you're fasting
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i have been told that sometimes the morning blood sugars are higher for some reason but i do n't know i i do n't really worry about it as long as it does n't get up too extremely high so
[doctor] and are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes yes that's along with the blood pressure medicine morning and night
[doctor] okay alright so are you are you eating like late at night or anything like that
[patient] no we usually eat by six
[doctor] okay okay alright well hopefully we can get you to feeling better okay so i want to do a quick physical exam really check that knee out so your vital signs look good they they look alright your temperature is ninety eight . two your pulse is seventy two respirations are sixteen blood pressure is one twenty two over seventy so that looks fine i'm gon na go ahead and take a listen to your heart and lungs so on your heart exam it's a nice regular rate and rhythm but i appreciate a slight two over six systolic ejection murmur at the left base here on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally okay now let's take a quick look at that knee so does it hurt when i press on it
[patient] no
[doctor] okay can you bend your knee and straighten it out
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na do some maneuvers and i'm gon na just gon na call out my findings on this okay on your right knee exam no ecchymosis or edema no effusion no pain to palpation of the of the left medial knee is there any decreased range of motion do you feel you feel like you're you're able to fully move that as you should the same as the other knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so no decreased range of motion negative varus and valgus test okay and so with your x-rays i reviewed the result of your left knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so lem me tell you a little bit about my plan so your left knee pain i think you just have some arthritis in that i want to prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams a day we might do some physical therapy for that just to strengthen the muscles around that area and prevent any further problems with that okay and so for your second problem the hypertension so i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams a day and order an echocardiogram just to evaluate that heart murmur alright and
[patient] okay
[doctor] for the diabetes mellitus i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c to see if we need to make any adjustments to your metformin and i'm also gon na order a lipid panel okay do you have any questions
[patient] no i do n't think so when will all this take place
[doctor] we will get you scheduled for the echocardiogram i will have my nurse come in and we will get that set up okay","S (Subjective):

[doctor] cough okay is it any mucus with it or is it a dry cough
[patient] more dry
[doctor] a dry cough okay and tell me more about this sore throat
[patient] this kind of seems to be persistent comes and goes it will be worse sometimes and then others it feels better trying to drink lots of fluids
[doctor] okay
[patient] to see if it can it you know the dry coughing if it's part of that or what i can do
[doctor] okay and when you mention drinking and eating is do you feel like anything is getting stuck there

[patient] i do have good family members that have been supportive and they have come to my treatment with me
[doctor] okay excellent excellent and so right now you're on a combination of two different chemotherapies the cisplestan as well as the eupside and you had your last treatment just a few days ago but you're saying right now you've been able to tolerate the nausea and the fatigue
[patient] yes i have n't had any nausea but you know just slight fatigue it does n't seem to be overwhelming
[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplacin and the etoside and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five grade and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss

aci_D2N082_nan,"[doctor] alright
[patient] you're ready just
[doctor] ready
[patient] hi kyle how are you today
[doctor] i'm doing well i'm just anxious about my pcp told me that i had some abnormal lab work and why she wanted me to be seen by you today
[patient] yeah i bet that did make you nervous i i see that she referred you for a low immunoglobulin a level is that your understanding
[doctor] yeah i mean i do n't even really understand what that means but yeah that's what she told me
[patient] yeah that's a mouthful
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it it's the the one of the antibodies in your body and that that really makes that your body makes to fight infections it's a little bit low i'm happy to explain it a little bit more to you i just have a few more questions okay so let's start again here
[doctor] i'll do this
[patient] i i think i would break that
[doctor] yeah i just saw that
[patient] if you can do that
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah so we'll we'll just
[doctor] okay
[patient] you can leave it the way it is for now i just i think break that up
[doctor] okay alright so yeah that sounds fine for me
[patient] yeah i do you know why she checked these levels in the first place that you've been having problems getting frequent infections
[doctor] yeah yeah i had a recent physical and she did this as part of her my physical i do tend to get infections but i do n't know i i'm so used to it so i do n't know if this is more than usual in the wintertime i get a lot of colds and they do seem to i always say that my colds kind of linger for a long time but i do n't know if it's more than usual
[patient] okay how about any abdominal infections
[doctor] diarrhea no
[patient] frequently
[doctor] no not that i can not that i say can think of
[patient] okay what about your family are are anyone in your family that you know have immune deficiencies
[doctor] no my family is actually pretty healthy
[patient] okay and how about do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] yeah my pcp just started me on metformin i just got diagnosed with type two diabetes
[patient] okay okay yeah diabetes your family your family owns that donut shop right i mean down at the end of the street
[doctor] yes and that's probably part of the cause of my diabetes yes
[patient] yeah well i guess you're gon na have to watch that
[doctor] i know i know
[patient] but you know everything in moderation i mean just you know you just need to be careful you ca n't does n't have to go away
[doctor] right
[patient] but have you ever needed to receive a blood transfusion or blood products
[doctor] no i actually tried to give blood but they i did n't qualify because i had recently traveled internationally
[patient] okay where did you go
[doctor] i was in zambia
[patient] hmmm i heard that's beautiful
[doctor] it's so beautiful it's so beautiful i had a great time
[patient] okay well let me let me go ahead and do a physical examination here i reviewed your vitals you know that the the assistants collected when you first came in including your weight and everything looks good there there is no fever there there is nothing that i'm concerned about there now on your heart exam you have a nice regular rate and rhythm and i do n't appreciate any murmurs that's kind of those extra sounds that i would hear and that that all sounds good on lungs lung exam your lungs are clear there's no wheezes rales or rhonchi now on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymph lymphadenopathy swollen lymph glands and then let me just go ahead and i wan na press on your belly a little bit is that tender anywhere that i press it does n't seem like you making any facial
[doctor] no
[patient] no okay so your you know your abdominal exam is your belly is soft there is no tenderness as i i push around there now i did review the results of your recent lab work and it is consistent as as your pcp noted with an iga deficiency that's that immunoglobulin a that we talked about so let me tell you a little bit about the assessment and plan so for your first problem the that a iga deficiency is it very common immunodeficiency your your body makes many different types of antibodies in one of your z iga is just a little bit lower than normal now most of the time people live their entire life without even knowing they have that deficiency and function perfectly normal now some people may find that they get tend to get frequent respiratory tract or sinus or abdominal infections but this does n't necessarily seem to be the case for you now it can go along with other immunodeficiencies but i think there is a low likelihood hood in your case but we're gon na order some additional blood work that includes checking those other antibodies now do you have any questions on what i just told you
[doctor] yeah so is there anything i need to do or should be watching for or should i be worried
[patient] no i i really do n't think you need to be worried now we're gon na check these additional studies and that will give us some more guidance but really i think this is just a finding that's common to you and you know it it's many people have have have these type of you know immunodeficiency what i want you to watch for is those infections that do n't stop you have trouble getting it under control or you know any changes to your abdominal tract you know severe diarrhea
[doctor] anything like that then you know we may want to look at it a little bit further but for now i do n't think there is anything significant we want to do now go ahead and get your lab work and
[patient] bring you in for that now the only other thing that i would say is if you eat end up needing any blood products between now and when i see you next make sure you tell them that you have that iga deficiency
[doctor] why is that
[patient] well there is a risk that your body can strongly react to some blood products and they just need to know that so they're prepared so anytime you get blood just make sure you say that you have a history of a an an iga deficiency

aci_D2N083_nan,"[doctor] hey lawrence how're you doing
[patient] i'm doing alright aside from this elbow pain
[doctor] so it looks like here that you came in to see us today for an evaluation of that right elbow pain can you tell me can you can you tell me well first of all what do you think has been causing that pain
[patient] so i really during this pandemic i really got into ceramics and doing pottery so i've been doing a lot of pottery and over the past week i then started to develop this elbow pain
[doctor] okay and then so tell me a little bit more about that elbow pain where does it hurt exactly
[patient] you know it hurts a lot in the inside of my elbow
[doctor] okay so the inside of your right elbow okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then does the pain radiate down your arm or up into your shoulder or anything like that
[patient] it does n't go into my shoulder it's it stays mostly at my elbow but it can go down a bit into my forearm
[doctor] okay and then do you remember any trauma did you hit your arm or elbow or any on anything
[patient] no nothing i i really was trying to think if there is anything else and i ca n't think of anything
[doctor] okay and you've never injured that right elbow before
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so now let's talk a little bit about your pain and how bad it how bad is that pain on a scale from zero to ten ten being the worst pain you've ever felt in your life
[patient] i would say probably a six
[doctor] okay and does that pain keep you up at night
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and when you have that kind of pain does it keep you from doing other type of activities
[patient] yeah i mean i still try to like work through with using my arm but yeah it's it's it's difficult for me sometimes to lift and do things because of that pain
[doctor] okay and then and how long has this pain been going on
[patient] about four days now
[doctor] alright and anything you've done to help relieve or alleviate that pain any anything that that's giving you relief
[patient] i've tried ibuprofen that helps a little but not much
[doctor] okay so if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam your vitals look good and i'm gon na do a focused exam on that right elbow i'm gon na go ahead and and and press here do you do you have any pain when i press here
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain to palpation you do note that moderate tenderness of the medial epicondyle now i'm gon na have you turn your wrist as if you're turning a door knob do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay now turn your wrist in so do you have any pain when you do that
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so you do have pain you were positive for pain when you pronate that that that forearm okay i'm gon na go ahead and have you rest your arm on the table here palm side up now i want you to raise your hand by bending at the wrist and i'm gon na put some resistance against it do you have any pain when i press against your flexed wrist
[patient] yes i do
[doctor] alright so you are positive for pain with resistance against flexion of that left wrist so i let let's go ahead and review the x-ray that we did of your elbow the good news is i do n't see any fracture or bony abnormality of that right elbow which is good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so for the problem with elbow pain i do believe that this is consistent with medial epicondylitis which is caused by the overuse and potential damage of those tendons that bend
[doctor] that that bend the wrist towards the palm now i want you to rest it i'm gon na order a sling and i want you to wear the sling while you're awake now we're also gon na have you apply ice to the elbow for twenty minutes three times a day and i want you to take ibuprofen that's gon na be six hundred milligrams q.6 h. with food and i want you to take that for a full week now you're not gon na like this part but i want you to hold off for the next couple of weeks on doing any type of pottery work okay alright now what i wan na do is i wan na see you again in a week and i wan na see how you're doing okay
[patient] alrighty
[doctor] alrighty so i'll have the nurse come in and get you set up with that sling and i will see you again in about a week

[patient] i have but i miss them every year and then so i think today i took one
[doctor] okay alright yeah i have you on bumex cozaar and norvasc does that sound right

[patient] no i have n't got one yet i know i needed to get one
[doctor] yeah that's that will be good if you can take your blood pressures at home and definitely track those what about any problems with shortness of breath lately

[patient] i've been pretty good on it very once every week maybe just one

[patient] well i've been having this sharp pain on the right side of my abdomen below my ribs for the last several days
[doctor] i saw my doctor and they ordered a cat scan and said i had a kidney stone and sent me to see a urologist okay well does the pain move or or or go anywhere or does it stay right in that same spot yeah it feels like it goes to my lower abdomen in into my groin okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go it comes and goes when it comes it's it's pretty it's pretty bad i feel like i ca n't find a comfortable position okay and do you notice any any pain when you urinate or when you pee

aci_D2N086_nan,"[doctor] hey nicholas nice to see you today your pcp looks like he sent you over for a nonhealing foot ulcer on your right foot can you tell me about how long you've had that
[patient] yeah i've had the boot for about six weeks i first noticed it when i put on a pair of shoes that were little bit too tight i felt some burning and some stinging and looked down and saw a blister i did n't think too much of it because it was on the pad of the bottom of my foot around my heel and i just had been walking on the front part of my foot i started to notice a foul smell and my wife mentioned something to me the other day and i noticed my dog was also smelling my socks a lot and so we looked and saw that the blister had become unroofed or the the top part of the skin of the blister became undone and then underneath it was just this really thick soft mushy skin that had a bad smell with some yellow drainage and so and barbara called the primary care doctor who then got me in to see you he started me on some antibiotics about six days ago and i never had any nausea or vomiting but my wife checked my temperature it was about ninety nine point seven and then at one point i had to put on an extra blanket in bed because i had some chills and when i started the antibiotics it started to feel pretty good but we've now noticed that it has turned black around the outside of the wound and i'm getting some cramping in my calf muscle as well and so there was a red streak also that was coming up the front part of my my ankle along the inside portion of my calf muscle and it's super super hot and so they wanted me to take a have have you look at it
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that history with me and did you complete that course of antibiotics
[patient] i think he called in ten days' worth and i'm on day six or seven right now i know i've got about two or three days left
[doctor] okay and you mentioned that it had some stinging and it was a bit uncomfortable are you experiencing any pain right now
[patient] yeah it was it was stinging initially like i had just done something small but at this point it's it's really like throbbing it's almost like there is a fire poker in the bottom of my foot now and then the inside of my calf muscle is really hard and i've noticed that every time that i push that i feel it all the way up to my knee behind my kneecap and then noticed that i've been coughing a lot the last two days and then i've noticed that i've had like difficult time catching my breath when i'm walking around the house and so it's almost like two different things going on at this point
[doctor] okay so now i see here in your record that you have some that you're diabetic and have some diabetic neuropathy as well how's your blood sugars been running i'm i'm assuming kind of all over the place over the last i'm gon na say probably three or four weeks can you tell me about that
[patient] yeah my my a1c is six point seven it's pretty well controlled
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to be on an insulin pump and i had an a1c that at one point was like thirteen but we worked with an endocrinologist to get it down to where it's at now i've been six point seven for probably two years now and i rarely have a blood sugar that goes over two hundred i check two or three times a day if i feel weird i'll check it again but i noticed my sugars have probably been trending in the three to four hundreds the last two weeks and then i had one spike at one point at like five or six hundred that got our attention and i think that's also what made my wife call the primary care doc
[doctor] okay now i know this was caused by a new pair of shoes you had mentioned before to your pcp and he relayed this to me that you really like to go on hikes you and your wife have been hiking have you gone to the new trails that that were just opened up here behind the park
[patient] yeah we actually hiked to charlie's bunion about a week before this i've had a new pair of diabetic shoes and inserts i get those every year i changed the inserts every three or four months i mean i've been in cruise control as far as that goes for some time i did get a new pair of shoes the prosthetist told me to check my feet every day for the first week or two which we did i did go hiking about the third or fourth day and i think that might be what caused it as i just went too far when we were hiking but yeah the trails are the trails are gorgeous they're open it's time to to be outside and i'm sorta stuck with this right now
[doctor] absolutely yeah my wife and i like to go back there and and hike those trails as well so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam for your vital signs i do recognize a slight fever however your vitals themselves look good now on your foot exam i do recognize the necrotic wound on your heel as you mentioned it is present it's approximately two by two centimeters i i do recognize the sloughing of the of the tissue as well as what looks like cellulitis around the area as well as erythemia so now unfortunately i do also smell the odor you are correct it is it does it is odds but i do not appreciate any bony exposure now on vascular exam i do have bilateral palpable pulses femorally and popliteal pulses are present however i do n't recognize a palpable pulse dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial however i did use the doppler and they are present via doppler now i'm gon na press on the actual affected area of the wound do you have any pain there
[patient] i do n't feel that right there
[doctor] okay i'm gon na review the results of your right foot x-ray that we did when you came in today the good news is i do n't see any evidence of osteomyelitis meaning that there is no infection of the bone so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for this nonhealing diabetic foot ulcer i'm going to order a test to check blood supply for this wound also i'm going to do a debridement today in the office we may have to look at we are going to do a culture and we may have to look at different antibiotic therapy i am concerned about the redness that's moving up your leg as well as this the the swelling and pain that you have in your calf so we're gon na monitor this very closely i wan na see you again in seven days and then as far as your diabetes is concerned i do want you to follow up with your endocrinologist and make sure that we do continue to keep your hemoglobin a1c below seven and we're gon na need to closely monitor your blood sugars since we're going to be doing some medication therapy with antibiotics and and potentially some other medications any other questions comments or concerns before i have the nurse come in we're gon na prep you for that procedure
[patient] no not really so you're gon na continue the antibiotics that i'm on and possibly extend or call in a new antibiotic depending on the culture
[doctor] correct
[patient] if i heard
[doctor] yep that's correct so what we're gon na do is you said you're six days in do a ten or twelve day course so we're gon na go ahead and continue your antibiotics therapy that your pcp put you on i do want to get the culture back and then we'll make the determination as far as additional or changing that antibiotic therapy

[doctor] okay
[patient] less
[doctor] i like it too alright are you taking the metformin twice a day
[patient] not everyday but most of the time
[doctor] okay alright and are you checking your blood sugars pretty regularly
[patient] i try to
[doctor] okay and do you do you know on average how they're running are they running below like one fifty or
[patient] yeah it's definitely running below that
[doctor] okay your blood sugars are running below
[patient] it's it's probably with with with the metformin it seems to be you know one twenty
[doctor] good
[patient] pretty regular
[doctor] good your blood sugars are running in the one twenties that's really good okay alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam okay so i'm looking here at your vital signs and your vital signs look really good i do think you're doing a good job with taking your lisinopril your blood pressure's about one twenty two over seventy right now which is right where we want it your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty seven again which is right where we want it and i do n't appreciate any fever today you you have a normal temperature at ninety eight . four which is really good so i'm just gon na be going ahead and calling out some physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what that means when i'm done okay so on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur rub or gallop on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally on your right knee exam i do appreciate some erythema and edema as well as an area of fluctuance over your right patella now does it hurt when i press
[patient] it's a little bit sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right anterior knee and i'm just gon na bend your knee up and down does that hurt at all
[patient] no no it's just more of the typical grinding that i would feel
[doctor] okay there is full range of motion of the right knee and on skin examination there is evidence of a bull's-eye rash over the right knee okay so what does that mean richard so that means that you know you do have some area of some inflammation over the over the right knee where you where you have that tick bite and you do have what we call that bull's eye rash which is what we get concerned about with with lyme disease so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you okay so for this first problem of your of your tick bite my concern is that you might have lyme disease based on the presentation of your right knee so i'm gon na go ahead and start you on doxycycline one hundred milligrams twice a day
[patient] we're gon na continue that for about three weeks i'm also gon na go ahead and send a lyme titer as well as a western blot to see if you do in fact have lyme lyme disease and we'll have to go ahead and just see how you do with this we you know i'd like to avoid intravenous antibiotics which i think we can avoid but i wanted to see how you do so
[doctor] do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah i did n't know what those last two things or just
[doctor] yeah so so we are gon na start you on some antibiotics to help help you with this
[patient] you know possible lyme disease and i'm gon na just order some blood tests just to see exactly what's going on and then you know sometimes people need intravenous antibiotics because lyme disease can cause problems on other organs like your heart that type of thing
[doctor] if not treated appropriately and sometimes we need to give antibiotics through the iv which i'd like to avoid i think that we got this early enough that we can just treat you with some oral antibiotics okay for your second problem of your hypertension you know i think you're doing a really good job let's go ahead and continue you on the lisinopril twenty milligrams once a day and i wan na just go ahead and order a lipid panel just to make sure that everything is okay with your cholesterol how does that sound
[patient] that's fine
[doctor] great and then for your third problem of your diabetes i wan na just go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c and continue you on the metformin one thousand milligrams twice a day it sounds like you're doing a good job since your blood sugars are running in the one twenties i do n't think we need to make any adjustments but we'll see what the hemoglobin a1c shows that gives us a an idea of what your blood sugars are doing on a long-term basis how does that sound
[patient] okay at what point time do you start kinda checking kidney function i've been told that metformin can possibly cause some kidney issues
[doctor] so it can you know your kidney function we've you know i think you've been really lucky it's been normal i checked it about two months ago and it looks pretty good it looks pretty normal but since we're doing blood work on you i can go ahead and order a a basic metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable
[patient] okay that'd be good
[doctor] okay anything else
[patient] not that i can think of at this time as soon as i leave
[doctor] well you know where to find me okay
[patient] alright

[doctor] okay . all right . in terms of your , your diabetes , how are you doing with that ? i know you're on the insulin pump .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] um , are your blood sugars okay ? have you noticed a spike in them recently ?
[patient] um , i have n't . i've been pretty good about monitoring it so i ... during the working week , i stay on top of that . but on saturdays or sundays we're so busy i forget to monitor it . but i have n't seen anything spike .
[doctor] okay . and i remember your affinity for chocolate bars , so ...
[patient] guilty as charged . i love chocolate bars .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , in terms of your depression , how are you doing with that ?
[patient] uh , it's been a crazy year and a half . um , i've tried some natural solutions . in the summer i did stretches outdoors every morning , which was great , but now the weather changed and , uh , you know , i've got ta find some alternatives . i'm not ready to try any medications just yet , so-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . i'm open to some suggestions .
[doctor] okay . we'll talk about that .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] and then in terms of your reflux , how are you doing ? i know we had you on the omeprazole .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] you were making some lifestyle modifications , cutting back on your red bull and caffeine .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] alcohol intake has been ... how's that been ?
[patient] tough during the holiday season , but i'm , i'm better .
[doctor] okay . all right . and no issues with your depression ? you do n't want to hurt yourself or anyone else ?
[patient] no . no . absolutely not .
[doctor] okay , all right . well , let's go ahead . i know you did a review of system sheet when you checked in and you endorsed the shortness of breath .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] any other symptoms ? chest pain , fever , chills , cough ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] um , belly pain ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . let's go ahead . i want to move on to a physical exam .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here in the office , you know , your vital signs look good . your , your pulse ox ... that's your oxygenation level ... looks good . so i'm encouraged by that with you just sitting here , okay ? i'm gon na go ahead and do another , uh , just check you over . i'll let you know what i find .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , on your exam things look okay . so , i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distension or any carotid bruits on your neck exam . on your heart exam , i do appreciate a slight 3 out of 6 systolic ejection murmur . on your lung exam , i do appreciate some crackles , bilaterally , at the bases . and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate 1+ pitting edema . so what does all that mean ? so , i do think that you're retaining some fluid . it's probably from some of the dietary indiscretion .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] but i wan na go ahead and look at some of the results , okay ? i had the nurse do a chest x-ray on you before we came in , okay ? hey , dragon ? show me the test x-ray . so i reviewed the results of your chest x-ray and it looks good . there's no e- evidence of any airspace disease , but that does n't mean that you still ca n't be retaining some fluid , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon ? show me the labs . and your labs look okay . you know , you do n't have an elevated white blood cell count so i'm not really concerned about infection . we saw the chest x-ray , there's no pneumonia , so that's good .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so , let's talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . okay ? so , for your first problem of your shortness of breath i think that you are in an acute heart failure exacerbation . i want to go ahead and , uh , put you on some lasix , 40 milligrams a day . i want you to weigh yourself every day .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] if your weight is n't going down , uh , or if it's going up i want you to call me . certainly , if you get more short of breath at rest i want you to go ahead and call me or call 911-
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] . and go into the emergency room . you might need some intravenous diuretics .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay ? for your second problem of your type i diabetes , um , let's go ahead ... i wan na order a hemoglobin a1c for , um , uh , just in a , like a month or so , just to see if we have to make any adjustments . and i want you to follow up with your endocrinologist . okay ? and i also want to make sure that you have a recent eye exam . all right ? uh , for your third problem of your depression , let's go ahead and refer you to psychiatry , just for some , um , like , talk therapy to help you through that . okay ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] no medications . and for your fourth problem of your reflux , let's go ahead and continue you on the omeprazole , 20 milligrams a day . do you have any questions , lawrence ?

[doctor] okay . all right . hey , dragon . i am seeing mrs. anderson , a 44-years-old female , uh , complaining to check the left shoulder pain . um , so how long how has this lasted ?
[patient] it's been a week , doctor . yeah .
[doctor] a week .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] um , did you take any medication yourself ?
[patient] no , i did not take any pain medications . actually , i did . i did take a tylenol for two or three days , but then that did n't help at all . so , uh , the reason why it started or when it started to happen is-
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] . i was actually in gymnastics class .
[doctor] yeah , okay .
[patient] and , uh , i do n't know . maybe i must have toppled over into some weird position , so it started to pain since then , uh , because of a certain move .
[doctor] okay , uh-
[patient] i went overboard , i think . yeah .
[doctor] all right , lem me , uh , take a quick look . uh , can you move up a little bit ? yeah .
[patient] uh , yeah . in fact , that's hurts .
[doctor] does that- does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does .
[doctor] what if you move back a little bit ?

[doctor] okay . all right , um , so let's ... hey , dragon . show me the last x-ray . all right , from the x-ray , it does n't look like there is any , uh , broken bone or fracture . my guess is you probably , um , hurt your joint , uh-
[patient] uh- .
[doctor] . a little bit .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so i would , uh , suggest you continue using the pain reliever , maybe just like 600 milligram of ibuprofen three times a day and use it for a week .
[patient] and for how long ? yes .
[doctor] for a week .
[patient] a week , okay .
[doctor] and then if you ... if it's still painful , you can use , uh , ice or , um , heat pad-

[patient] can i , uh , carry any heavy weights or-
[doctor] no , no . definitely not .
[patient] . anything like that ?
[doctor] definitely not .
[patient] okay . okay .

[patient] okay .

[doctor] mm . that does not sound like fun . it sounds like you injured it going up the stairs ?
[patient] yes , that's correct . it was icy , and i have to walk up a flight of stairs to my house . i stepped and my feet just went out . fell on my left side . seems like my shoulder and wrist took the brunt . it's been hurting since .
[doctor] yeah , that does seem like a likely cause of your symptoms . anything seem to make the pain worse ?
[patient] well , i've always hit the gym and lifted weights . i've been trying to keep with my routine of two days a week , but it's been hard . the pain is worse when i lift , and i have n't been able to lift more than 15 or 20 pounds which is very frustrating .
[doctor] mm-hmm . i can imagine it is when you're so accustomed to your routine .
[patient] exactly . i really enjoy my exercise , but over the past one to two weeks , i've stopped hitting the gym because the pain just was n't worth it honestly . i do keep up with my walking , though . my wife and i walk about 30 minutes almost every day . we have done this since i retired from my office job last year .
[doctor] i do not blame you , mr . james . does anything seem to help the pain that you've tried ?
[patient] not too much . i have iced a bit , but i have not taken anything for the pain . stopping exercise and some ice has helped a bit , but it still hurts enough for me to come to see you .
[doctor] yeah , okay . how about any numbness or tingling ? have you felt that at any point ?
[patient] no , doc . just pain . no tingling or numbless , numbness , thankfully .
[doctor] understood . understood . all right . well , let's go ahead and take a look and see what's going on .

[patient] so what are the possible treatments ?
[doctor] well , we have a few options you can try . first option would be to start with physical therapy . i would recommend two sessions per week as well as any other exercises they give you to do at home . we can start there and if that does n't improve your pain , then we could try a cortisone injection .
[patient] i like the idea of starting with the physical therapy and have a next step if it does n't help . i am not opposed to a shot but would like to try the therapy first .
[doctor] all right . great . i'll get a referral order , and they will call you within the next day or two to get you scheduled .

[doctor] hello , how are you doing today ?
[patient_guest] we're okay , thank you .
[doctor] that's good to hear . so , how many days has randy been feeling sick ?
[patient_guest] well , i would say it started around supper time last night .
[doctor] last night , okay , and what's been going on ?
[patient_guest] well , he started to get a runny nose .
[doctor] okay , and is he stuffy too ?
[patient_guest] yeah . yeah .
[doctor] okay , and have you noticed , is his mucous clear right now ?
[patient_guest] it is , it is right now , yes .
[doctor] okay . and , does he also have a cough ?
[patient_guest] yes , but it's not barky .
[doctor] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ?
[patient_guest] well , i know he's been pulling on his ears , yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] you know , he also , he's also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too .
[doctor] okay . and , any fever you've noticed ?
[patient_guest] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 .
[doctor] okay . so , a little bit of a low-grade fever there , definitely . and , how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ?
[patient_guest] yes , he did . yeah .
[doctor] and how about this morning ? did he eat his breakfast ?
[patient_guest] uh , this morning he ate about seven ounces from the bottle .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] and then he got another bottle , and he barely ate that . um , i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] so , he varies i guess .
[doctor] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps , or does he have pretty good energy ?
[patient_guest] mmm , it seems like he's irritable .
[doctor] irritable because he is n't feeling good ?
[patient_guest] yeah . he is energetic , but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep , like , he's fighting it really hard .
[doctor] okay , and just for the chart , is there anyone , anybody else exposed to him who has been sick ?
[patient_guest] yes , his older sister's been sick .
[doctor] thank you .
[patient_guest] we also had a play date with my nephew , who i learned later had a sinus infection .
[doctor] and what medication have you tried for him ? anything at all ?
[patient_guest] um , i've been doing the saline mist in his nose .
[doctor] good , good . that's a good choice .
[patient_guest] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him , and we had the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating .
[doctor] i see . and , any other medications ?
[patient_guest] we did put some baby vick's on his feet last night to try and help him breathe . and , i also used the humidifier .
[doctor] okay . that's good .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] so , there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here . it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse . what are you using on it ?
[patient_guest] i've been using the cradle cap brush , and then i use regular aveno shampoo .
[doctor] is it a dandruff shampoo ?
[patient_guest] no , i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we'll talk about the next steps .
[patient_guest] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] can you take a big breath randy .
[patient_guest] where's mama ?
[doctor] do n't forget to breathe little one . okay . let's try the front too .
[patient_guest] yeah , it's okay buddy .
[doctor] excellent . he's doing excellent . next let's- let's check out those ears .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over .
[patient_guest] dino , you're doing so good .
[doctor] all right . ears look okay . we're going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down .
[patient_guest] hey , you're- hey you're okay . you're okay .
[doctor] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like .
[patient_guest] all right . thank you .
[doctor] all right . so , he's just kind of getting started with this , and i think we're seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away . but , i do n't think he needs any antibiotics , at least not at this point in time . um , keep up with the fluids , rest , and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant and a little more severe . so , if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine .
[doctor] you know , i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] actually , i will . i'll go ahead and just give you some as well .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] but , if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it . it only works for the barky cough .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , got it .
[doctor] okay . we'll do the same thing with him , as long as nothing gets worse , and we'll see him back in one week . so , it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's , but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so , if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him , it can help out a little bit with the regular cough .
[patient_guest] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ?
[doctor] yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year , instead , you can give them agave , which is a different type of nectar . um , now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him , it would not be very good because his stomach acid's not good enough to break down the botulism spores . so , it'd cause him harm . um , you should look at the package of say , honey nut cheerios . it says right on there to not give it to a baby .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] now , whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure , but it has real honey in it . so , no honey for him , but agave is definitely fine .
[patient_guest] okay . so , zarbee's for the stuffy nose .
[doctor] yes , zarbee's .
[patient_guest] and then you said , uh , which medicine to give him just in case ?
[doctor] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister , and just hang onto it , um , just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , um , but since , um , if it's gon na be the weekend , and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow night , i'd rather you have just what you need on hand .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] right , does that make sense ?
[patient_guest] yeah , yeah . that makes sense .
[doctor] okay , great . and that way you do n't have to share , um , with his sister .
[patient_guest] right , okay .
[doctor] and since he's about half her size , we'll do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon .
[patient_guest] okay . will this information all be in the papers ?
[doctor] yes . and so , if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for five days .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is , "" as needed , "" or anything like that .
[patient_guest] mm-hmm , understood , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[patient_guest] and the cradle cap ?
[doctor] what i would do is use something like either head & shoulder's , or selsun blue , or nizoral ad . now , do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . um , cradle cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff . so , those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing 'cause they , um , they are all dead scales , and you still have to brush them off . so , continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil , or something that will help get the scales out , and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not every day , but maybe twice a week .
[doctor] so , two days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then , often , within six weeks or so , you'll notice that the-the cradle cap is just , um , not coming back anymore . but , he has to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes . so , just make sure when you're rinsing his hair you avoid his eyes .
[patient_guest] okay . okay .
[doctor] all right . and , if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know .
[patient_guest] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] good . and , since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out .
[patient_guest] okay . and both appointments in the week ?
[doctor] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better .
[patient_guest] all right , great . thank you so much .

virtscribe_D2N101_nan,"[doctor] patient is julia jones , date of birth 5/16/1996 . she is a new breast reduction consult . hello , how are you doing today ? i'm dr. gonzalez . it's nice to meet you .
[patient] nice to meet you , ma'am . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm doing good , thank you . so you're here to discuss a breast reduction , correct ?
[patient] yes . that's right .
[doctor] okay . perfect . let me just get logged in , here . have you met with anyone before about a breast reduction ?
[patient] no , i have n't .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been considering this ?
[patient] it's probably been about six or seven years . but i mean , it's always been in the back of my mind .
[doctor] well , i perform a lot of breast reduction surgeries , pretty much every week , so it is a very common procedure .
[patient] okay , that's reassuring .
[doctor] yeah . so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having . and then i'll do a quick exam .
[patient] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] and then we'll talk more about the surgery and what it entails . and , um , at this point , who is your insurance provider ?
[patient] i have blue cross blue shield . well , actually , my husband just accepted a new job , and i will be on his plan , uh , which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing .
[doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , i'll document your symptoms , symptoms , we'll take some pictures , then , um , they get sent to the insurance company . and what they'll do is decide whether it's approved , or medically necessary , or not . but we wan na make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you'll be on the new plan ?
[patient] most likely july .
[doctor] okay . so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ?
[patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . i do have a lotta pain here and here . but i do n't know if it's all from my breasts or not . it gets painful and builds up . so i think i could attribute it to my breasts , when i'm working at my desk all day .
[doctor] okay . and in your neck and your upper back . and how long has this been going on ? would you say five years , 10 years , or even since puberty ?
[patient] i would say since i was in high school .
[doctor] okay . and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders ? um , i saw that you're wearing about a g cup .
[patient] yes . i do get indentations , but i do n't really wear a regular bra that often . i mostly were a 34 e sports bra because it's more comfortable . and the others are expensive in my size .
[doctor] yeah , i have heard that as well . and , um , have you had any children , or are you planning to have any children in the future ?
[patient] no , i do not have any kids now . but we might plan to in the future .
[doctor] okay . and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the s- in the hands or any nipple pain ?
[patient] sometimes , yes .
[doctor] okay . and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts ? and , and it could be from sweating .
[patient] no , but they are always sweaty .
[doctor] okay . and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ?
[patient] there's certain things i do when i have to hold them , like working out and any jumping or running . and it hurts .
[doctor] and it hurts , okay . and , and you saw a chiropractor . but what about physical therapy for your back pain ? or do you take any pain medicine for it ?
[patient] y- no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol .
[doctor] that's okay . so let's see . i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms ? and how old was your mother when she had it ?
[patient] mom was 40 . and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still ... i mean , i'm 25 . so i'm still a little bit young .
[doctor] okay . and otherwise , it seems like you're really healthy ?
[patient] yes , for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months , and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds .
[doctor] congratulations . that's great . and then , um-
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] . so then ... you're welcome . and so do you use any tobacco , drugs , or alcohol ? and then , um , you said that you were going to school . what are you going to school for ?
[patient] uh , i drink a little wine on occasion , and for school , i'm currently studying psychology .
[doctor] okay , that's great . all right . so what we'll do is we'll go ahead and take a look . i'm gon na take a couple of measurements . and we'll kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . um , so go ahead and stand up for me , julia . okay . so , looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i think you're a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast .
[patient] okay . that's fine .
[doctor] and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain , and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well .
[patient] right .
[doctor] so typically , when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath . and it kinda looks like , um , an anchor below . then straight down , and underneath , and through that incision , we're able to f- to lift the breast . and we'll take off any extra fat and breash- breast tissue . so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup . so i do tell every patient we can make you as small as your blood supply allows . and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of its blood supply during the surgery .
[patient] okay . well , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c. um , a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and typically the surgery takes about three hours . you will have drains , one in each side . and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast . and that stays in for about a week . and then we'll remove them in the clinic . and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars . and , um , we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first . and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line .
[patient] okay . well , i'm not too worried about the scars .
[doctor] okay . and i do like to keep patients overnight . it's just going to be for one night in the hospital . and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day . but you know that some people get nauseated , and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility .
[patient] okay , yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breastfeed after a breast reduction , and the reason is the breast is made up of fat . and it's also made up of a gland . and the gland is what produces the milk .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands . so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breastfeed in the future . and then also , the breast will change over time . if you , um , gain weight , they will get larger , things like that .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and if you have children , they will change as well . they will enlarge , especially if you can breastfeed . but they'll go back down and will appear , um , a little bit deflated .
[patient] yeah . i do n't know if i'm interested in breastfeeding .
[doctor] okay . um , the hormones of pregnancy , though , will change the breasts , so that's just something to be aware of , and i tell all younger patients that .
[patient] okay , yeah . absolutely .
[doctor] and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you'll have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple . generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction . and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised , and then it just takes some time for that to go away .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] but other than that , you know , most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions , julia , about the process or anything like that ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . and , i do think you're a good candidate for it . and i think you'll benefit from it as well .
[patient] good . i look forward to a relief .
[doctor] i think you just have to do it when you are ready , when you know that you feel like it's a good time , because it is a commitment , and you will have some activity restrictions for about six weeks after surgery , uh , no heavy lifting . and i do say no driving for two to three weeks . and the drains stay in , like i said , for about a week .
[patient] okay . well , i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over .
[doctor] okay . well , i think from this point , if you want to , we can take photos today , while you're here . i have all the documentation now in the note about your symptoms , and that's what the insurance company is going to look for . so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted . and then , when they approve it , um , what the office will do , is they'll work with you on a surgery date , and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions and go over the instructions in more detail , things like that .
[patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information .
[doctor] that sounds great . and then we can get it all in process . and it was so nice to meet you . and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25 year old female with symptomatic macromastia , presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments , but the minimal relief , and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection , based on a bsa of 2.65 , with the schnur scale is 1,792 grams , which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a nipple graft .

[patient] yes , ma'am .
[doctor] well , it looks like you have one stone in the left kidney but it's not obstructing anything .
[patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment . and then for the past six weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine the color of , like , cherry kool-aid . and last week , i was constantly having to pee and it hurt something terrible .
[doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of zero to 10 ? zero being no pain and 10 being worse , as you can imagine .
[patient] um , at the time , i'd say an eight .
[doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ?
[patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better .
[doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 milligrams a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ?
[patient] that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well , mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately , you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have one stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time .
[patient] i'd like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones .
[doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk , such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease and certain medical conditions .
[patient] yeah , i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything .
[doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day .
[patient] so , if i weight 250 pounds , i should drink ?
[doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew .
[patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ?
[doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium oxalate and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed food because they're high in sodium . ideally , you should consume less than 1,000 milligrams of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork .
[patient] what's oxalate ?
[doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants , that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from . foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rhubarb and soy products .
[patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again .
[doctor] great . and here's a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid .
[patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help me remember .

[doctor] ms. sanchez , it's good to see you again .
[patient] yeah , it's good seeing you too dr. hughes . you look like you're doing well .
[doctor] i am , thank you . you too . you're looking great . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] pretty good . i'm definitely feeling better , thank goodness . i was having a rough time before surgery , um , but i think i'm overall pretty good now though .
[doctor] okay . well , that's really good to hear . i'm glad . are you having any new symptoms right now ?
[patient] no , not really . but , you know , i'm still getting some chest pains sometimes , and my breathing gets shallow . but , i guess i'm learning what i can and ca n't do . uh , so if i feel like that , if i'm , like , exerting myself , i slow down a bit which helps , and then when i go back to it later , i can usually finish whatever i was doing .
[doctor] okay . so , it does go away though ? how long does an episode seem to last ?
[patient] uh , only a few minutes i guess . then it disappears for a while . it's weird .
[doctor] what is a while ?
[patient] it goes away for a couple weeks . um , so when it happens , i just take the day nice and slow , i do n't push myself .
[doctor] okay . so , maybe it's a couple times a month you feel this way ?
[patient] yeah , just often enough for me to notice .
[doctor] understood . okay . are you taking your medications regularly ?
[patient] uh- . i've been trying to keep up with that . there's a lot of extra pills now , but i have a reminder app , so i do pretty well .
[doctor] okay . that's great . and so , you're taking coumadin , right ?
[patient] yeah , also lasix and the atenolol .
[doctor] are you having any side effects from the medications at all ?
[patient] not really . uh , i notice that the atenolol is making me irritable in the beginning , but i guess i've gotten used to it , does n't seem to bother me as much now .
[doctor] okay . well , that sounds good . sounds like you're well on the mend . so , why do n't i start out , um , with the physical exam , and just check you out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you're going to hear me describe things in detail or repeat things as i go to reference later for my notes .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay then . i'm going to be using my status post template , ms. sanchez , please lie down on the table here and we'll get started . all right . can you turn your head to the left . head and neck no jvd detected . you can turn back now and just take a couple of deep breaths for me please . okay , that's good . and lungs have reduced breath , but auscultation and percussion are clear . okay . breath normally , i'm just going to listen to your heart . rhythm is irregularly irregular .
[patient] that's a funny statement . what does that mean ?
[doctor] yeah , it does sounds kind of weird , right ? it's when your heart does n't beat with the correct rhythm , and whatever rhythm it does n't have a pattern to it . so , it's part of the atrial fibrillation .
[patient] wow , that sounds like a mess .
[doctor] yeah , it's not ideal . but , many people have a-fib are able to keep it under control with medicine and lifestyle changes .
[patient] agh , i see . that's good to know .
[doctor] okay . so , s1 slightly accentuated , no s3 . i'm going to touch your belly , and does any of that hurt .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] how about there ? and your feet ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay , great . and trace peripheral edema on extremities . all right ms. sanchez , you can sit up now . so , it looks like your heart valves are working well and you are recovering from the surgery nicely .
[patient] good .
[doctor] yes . we are , we looked at your ecg taken earlier today , and we are seeing the a-fib , but it's being well controlled with the medicine , and you're taking coumadin , four milligrams , lasix at four milligrams a day , and the atenolol , you're taking that every day as well , right ?
[patient] yes . the 50 milligrams every day .
[doctor] great . it sounds like you're well on your way to recovery .
[patient] great .
[doctor] so , let's continue on your current meds . i'm glad that you're figuring out what your body can handle . definitely try to keep active as that will certainly help .
[patient] i'll do my best .
[doctor] and that's about it . do you have any questions for me ?

[doctor] good afternoon . how are you today ?
[patient] i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ?
[patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have , or really even what it is .
[doctor] okay . so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea , or is that completely new as far as you know ?
[patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur . so of course , i'm worried as well .
[doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ?
[patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having .
[doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one . so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to ?
[patient] no , i definitely do n't .
[doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or f- feel shortness of breath ?
[patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . um , my problem is i have severe pains in my legs , and so she had me going for a chest x-ray , and that was just last week .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs .
[doctor] okay , got it , for the legs . and do you feel short of breath at all ?
[patient] if i walk too fast or too long , or if i tried to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way .
[doctor] okay . and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ?
[patient] well , i do have a walker now , so i do n't know . maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or i walk around the culdesac .
[doctor] got it . all right .
[patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all . um , maybe more if i try to overdo it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] then i , um , i get short of breath if i do overdo it though .
[doctor] okay , got it . and so how different would you say , um , that the symptoms are now compared to like six months ago or a year ago ?
[patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about six months ago . before that i did n't notice anything at all .
[doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ?
[patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now .
[doctor] okay . and how about , do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ?
[patient] yeah . so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] yeah , and i do n't take it every day , only when i do feel dizzy .
[doctor] okay . and so how about any passing out at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heartbeats ? do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ?
[patient] i do n't notice it at all .
[doctor] okay , great . and how about any swelling in the legs at all ?
[patient] yeah , my ankles swell .
[doctor] okay . and how long has this been going on ?
[patient] um , i would say for probably six months . but it goes up and down , and sometimes it's worse than other times .
[doctor] okay . and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ?
[patient] um , i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh a 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay .
[patient] um , but that's been going down gradually for about a year .
[doctor] okay . and then how about any fevers , chills or anything else that's , that's going on that you can think of ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in , um , mostly because of the murmur . is that right ? and sort of just kind of seeing what things look like ?
[patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication .
[doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well . and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ?
[patient] i'm not really sure .
[doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of sh- , uh , surgeries here , ?
[patient] yeah , you name it .
[doctor] all right . well , i wo n't make you repeat them since i do have a good record . um , but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? all right . got them . and then , are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay , good . and looking at your family history , it looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack . is that correct ?
[patient] it was actually my son , not my brother .
[doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment .
[patient] um , but my brother did have a stroke . but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes , and my eldest sister did have a heart problem as well .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , it looks like also that you never smoked . that's excellent . and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] all right . well , let's do a quick exam .
[patient] all right . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . all right , please just breathe normally . great . and now take a few deep breaths for me . all right . do you feel okay ? are you feeling any dizziness or anything ?
[patient] no , i feel fine .
[doctor] okay , great . all right . well , that is it for the exam .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so what i'm thinking is , let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart . and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i can order that for today . um , do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long .
[patient] yes , that's fine . i have time .
[doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today , um , to assess your overall cardiac structure and function , as well as , uh , the valve view of where diseased .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and some hospital outcomes and what we might suggest to fix that out , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called , um , aortic stenosis , and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open , um , quite fully . and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body , and that's called the aorta , into the rest of your body .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement , or we just call it tavr . and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve .
[patient] well , i would have to think about that . i'm not too sure i'd wan na do that , given my age of all .
[doctor] yeah , sure , no problem . and we do n't have to make any decisions today , just , you know , wanted to go over a couple of these things . um , but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement , or it's called an savr . but really , because of your age and medical history , um , unfortunately , that would n't be a good option for you .
[patient] i see . okay . well , i guess we'll see , um , what you see from , from the , um , test .
[doctor] yeah , agreed . okay . and , um , so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we're not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril . so just continue taking those as you are currently .
[patient] okay , good .

On cardiovascular exam, the patient has a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids.

The patient’s S2 is relatively preserved.

The patient’s gait is normal for her age.

The clinician’s assessment is that the systolic murmur is most likely representative of aortic stenosis.

The echocardiogram is intended to assess overall cardiac structure and function.

The echocardiogram is intended to assess the cardiac valves.

The clinician suspects possible aortic stenosis as the cause of the murmur.

The clinician explains that aortic stenosis involves narrowing of a main heart valve that does not open fully.

The clinician explains that aortic stenosis can reduce or block blood flow from the heart into the aorta and the rest of the body.

If the aortic stenosis is severe, the clinician may recommend a transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

aci_D2N107_nan,"[doctor] so bryan it's nice to see you again in the office today what's going on
[patient] i was in my yard yesterday and i was raking leaves and i felt fine and then when i got into my house about two hours later my back started tightening up and i started getting pins and needles in my right foot
[doctor] alright have you ever had this type of back pain before
[patient] i had it once about three years ago but it went away after a day
[doctor] okay and did you try anything for the pain yet did you take anything or have you have you tried icing
[patient] put some ice on it and i tried two advils and it did n't help
[doctor] okay does it get better when you're laying down sitting standing
[patient] yeah i think the only thing that helped was a hot shower and it feels a little better when i sit
[doctor] okay alright so you said you were raking leaves and now it's been kind of that weather outside for cleaning out the yard have you been doing a lot of yard work lately
[patient] i i i normally do n't do any physical activity
[doctor] yeah i hear you i make a i make my husband do all the yard work too so alright let me take a look at that low back if if you bend over does that hurt
[patient] it hurts a little bit when i bend over yes
[doctor] okay how about when you stand back up
[patient] no pain
[doctor] okay so no pain on extension some pain on flexion how about when i push right here on your back
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] okay so some pain to palpation right around the l5 can i have that
[patient] what happens when family members chime in like i'm doing right now because i actually think it was it hurts more when he stands up because i've watched him bend over but it's when he stands up that it really hurts
[doctor] okay and and what's your relationship
[patient] partners
[doctor] okay so your partner is here with you today and reports that he is also having pain when you are standing up
[patient] i've spent so many times you know who i am
[doctor] so that's right you always come in together have you noticed anything else partner when when he is
[patient] i'm worried about it because he is you know his pain tolerance is so high and he would n't be saying anything if it really was n't a problem because it's not at all like last week when he thought about raking leaves but did n't actually rake leaves but then his back did n't hurt as much but this time it really hurts
[doctor] okay so you think this is more of a long term injury
[patient] no he was just thinking about it hurting when he thought about raking but it did n't
[doctor] okay alright and have you noticed any any prior pain with with the back
[patient] i do n't want to take this away you better go back to talking to him
[doctor] that's alright let's see how it turns out okay so how about if you if i push down on both your feet like this can you push back up on my hands
[patient] can you repeat that
[doctor] if i'm pushing down on your feet can you push push your feet back
[patient] i
[doctor] alright so your dorsiflexion is normal looks like pulses are equal in all extremities you said you had a little bit of a tingling sensation in which leg
[patient] that would be my right leg
[doctor] okay so some tingling in your right leg alright so i know that you had an x-ray when you came in because we always do x-rays when we have our patients come in of your low back and everything looks normal from that perspective so for your back pain sounds like you probably sprained your low back so i what i want you to do is let's rest it i'm going to prescribe some meloxicam have you taken that before
[patient] i have not taken meloxicam
[doctor] alright so i'll prescribe that i'm also gon na prescribe some physical therapy i know you said you have n't been overly active and your partner reported the same thing for a long time so we might wan na get you into some pt and hopefully get you back back in shape get you some stretches that you can do and some exercises and then you know if it's not improving i want you to send me a message and we can possibly look into see if there is anything else going on potentially an mri if it's still not improving does that sound like an okay plan
[patient] it sounds reasonable
[doctor] alright
[patient] i think he should have an mri now i think he had surgery yesterday i think he should have an mri now this it's been hurting for like six hours now and she had an mri we are really worried about it
[doctor] alright you know let's give it a couple of weeks and let's give it two weeks and then call me back and we'll get you an mri if it's still not improving

aci_D2N108_nan,"[doctor] hey gregory good to see you today so take a look at my notes and i see that you're here you've had a nonhealing foot ulcer so can you tell me how you're doing how long have you had it what's going on with it
[patient] sure so i've had it for about two months now and it's recently become red and is draining so i was concerned about how it's healed
[doctor] okay and when you when you got it would you have any trauma to your foot or it just just did it pop up all of a sudden
[patient] i think i may have gotten it from walking barefoot on the beach
[doctor] okay alright and i saw you you did see your pcp before you came in did they put you on antibiotics
[patient] they did start me on some medication but i did n't i did n't pick them up from the pharmacy yet
[doctor] okay do you know which ones that they prescribed for you
[patient] i do n't recall the name exactly
[doctor] do n't recall alright
[patient] something i had taken it before
[doctor] okay so when you what beach did you go to when you you hurt it
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] so i was asking which beach did you did you go to when you hurt your foot
[patient] at i was at dewey beach in my ambulance
[doctor] dewey beach wow that sounds like fun i wish i could be a mab right now but all or as lucky as i guess as you are to go to dewey beach okay so does it hurt
[patient] it sometimes it throbs does n't i do n't have specific pain but sometimes it does feel like there is some throbbing going on and again my my biggest concern is the it started to drain and it looks a little red
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had that before
[doctor] okay and that makes sense alright so as far as your diabetes you know and i think that's probably a a major cause of this not being able to heal how well are how well is that controlled
[patient] i take my medication but i do n't check my sugar all the time
[doctor] okay do you
[patient] i'm not really sure how
[doctor] okay do you know what your last a1c is i'm pretty sure you doc talk to you about it
[patient] i think they told me it was around ten
[doctor] around ten okay yeah that that's that's definitely pretty high yeah you definitely if your if your pcp has n't gotten created treatment plan for you definitely need to go back and see them so you can get that controlled alright so let me do a quick physical exam on your foot here today your vital signs look normal you do n't have a fever so let me just take a look at your foot so on your foot exam there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint there is some redness some drainage present you have some edema around it there is fluid like you said that's coming out of it i do n't see any necrosis you do n't have any odor and i do n't appreciate any bony exposure so it pretty much is like you said it's it's red it's swollen i think you have an infection in there as well so when i touch it does that hurt
[patient] no i i feel like increased pressure but it's not distinct
[doctor] okay alright that's good so before you came in we did get an x-ray of your right foot and there is no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that luckily you do n't have a bone infection so that's great i think it's just in your skin so let's talk a little bit about your assessment and plan so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer and what i wan na do is i wan na order an abi ankle brachial index just to determine the blood supply in your foot to see if we can actually heal that ulcer i'm gon na also perform a debridement here just to take off some of that dead tissue and then i'm gon na prescribe you some clindamycin you can do that four hundred milligrams you take that for seven days take that twice a day just to try to get rid of that infection which you currently do have and that will get rid of some of that that redness and and drainage that that's happening right now did your doc did your pcp give you a surgical shoe something that you would wear while this is happening
[patient] they did n't they mentioned that you may be able to give it to me
[doctor] okay yeah we could definitely get you a a shoe because if you wear your regular shoes that pressure on that foot can really irritate it and take you backwards so i'll get you a shoe where you can wear that for the next month you know we just wan na make sure that it does heal and then i wan na see you back again in two weeks and we can we'll possibly do another debridement at that time we'll just take a look and see how the tissue is doing so how does that sound
[patient] that sounds great
[doctor] alright do you have any other question
[patient] i do if anything happens in between
[doctor] please feel free to call the office yeah please feel free to call you call the office we can definitely get you in you know if you are having any other issues and if it's an emergency if you feel like you're getting a fever feeling well please go to the urgent care or the er if you feel getting black or anything like that but otherwise we'll see you back in two weeks

[doctor] okay and how long have you had the wound
[patient] about two to three weeks
[doctor] okay have you had any kind of trauma to that foot
[patient] no i bought a new pair of shoes to travel with and the neuropathy i guess i did n't feel that they were too tight at first it was just a blister but it looked a lot worse now i've been putting a band-aid on it and
[doctor] okay and so did your doctor put you on any antibiotics when they they saw your foot
[patient] yes i finished the course yesterday the wound looked about the same though
[doctor] okay now does it hurt
[patient] no i ca n't feel it
[doctor] okay now have you had any other symptoms like fever chills drainage from the wound or anything along those lines
[patient] no but when i take my sock off sometimes it sticks to the wound even when i put a band-aid on
[doctor] okay well are you still wearing those same shoes that cause the problem
[patient] no i'm upset
[doctor] i'm so upset too i love those shoes
[patient] no i'm so upset i i love those shoes
[doctor] okay so what kind of shoes are they
[patient] they're hoka's
[doctor] ah so where did you get them
[patient] i got them at rei couple of years ago
[doctor] they're pretty good about helping you to fit your fit you in a shoe are n't they
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so what do you like about them
[patient] they are comfortable they are easy to take on and off and they provide good stability
[doctor] that's good so you've had some issues with stability sometimes or
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay okay well another question i want to ask you is how is your diabetes doing
[patient] i do n't think it's too bad my last hgb a1c was a little over eight
[doctor] okay alright well let me just do a quick physical exam okay for vital signs your temperature is ninety eight . one your vital signs look good your heart rate is seventy two respirations sixteen blood pressure is one ten over sixty five okay so on your foot exam let's see there is a one by two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot it is just proximal to the right fifth to the fifth mtp joint and there is some yellow slough present with minimal granulation tissue there's no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there's no evidence of fluid collection there's no necrosis there is no odor i do not appreciate any bony exposure on on vascular exam there are palpable bilateral femoral and popliteal pulses there are no palpable dp or pt pulses but doppler signs are present okay so does this hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no it's okay
[doctor] okay alright so i've reviewed the results your right foot x-ray that we did before you i came in the room and this shows no evidence of osteomyelitis which means there is no evidence of bone infection so that's really good so let me tell you a little about my assessment and plan for you so for your first problem your diabetic foot ulcer so i want to order an ankle brachial index abi to determine the blood supply to your foot to see if you can heal this wound i'm also gon na perform a debridement here in the office to take off some of the dead tissue and then next i'm going to prescribe a collagenase ointment to be applied to the wound once daily and then cover with a dry sterile dressing now we will continue this until we see the wound shrinking and a nice pink tissue is present and i want you to wear a surgical shoe to take pressure off of the area okay so i do n't think any more antibiotics are needed at this time and i want to see you again in two weeks so we may need to refer you to a vascular specialist if the abi indicates your blood supply is not optimal for wound healing okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so for your diabetes it's gon na be very important to get your diabetes under control in order to get the wound to heal so we might even go ahead and get a diabetic consult so that we can go over some some maybe some ways you can modify your diet without a being too much but maybe that can bring down your hemoglobin a1c into a little bit better level okay

[patient] my right
[doctor] okay your right knee and so based on like your inside and outside which part hurts more
[patient] it's kind of the outside of the knee
[doctor] alright so the lateral aspect not a problem and you said that you heard a pop when you landed right
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] just tylenol
[doctor] alright so did the tylenol help
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay alright and so hmmm when does it have you tried anything else like did you ice it use heat anything like that
[patient] no i just kinda elevated it and that was about it
[doctor] okay that's fine and how long ago did this happen
[patient] a week ago
[doctor] okay alright so you put up with the pain for a week that's i'm proud of you for that
[patient] i do n't like to come to the doctors
[doctor] excuse me i feel rejected right now why why would you say something like that it's fine but you know i i like it when you're not here either because that means that you're doing a good job so let's see about like getting your knee fixed up but i want to talk about some of the other issues that you have first so we know that you have hypertension right and i discussed maybe you getting a blood pressure cuff because i needed you to measure those a bit more regularly did you get the cuff
[patient] what no
[doctor] no okay that's fine have you measured your blood pressure recently at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay are you still taking your medication because i see you're on twenty milligrams of lisinopril
[patient] yeah most days i remember
[doctor] okay
[patient] ra i'm not suspicious but we're just gon na go with that okay because looking at your vitals it it is of still a bit high i'm not really comfortable i see like a hundred and eighty over you know eighty and
[doctor] that's not where we wan na be so i wonder if we might need to adjust your medication but let's talk about your diabetes how are your blood sugars
[patient] i think they're little bit better
[doctor] okay what makes you think that have you been taking them
[patient] yeah i check it you know most days again kinda when i remember
[doctor] okay how often are you checking it
[patient] i would say four five times a week
[doctor] okay you might wan na switch to maybe two or three times a day but you know that's something i'm glad that you are measuring are you taking your metformin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then i think we have you on five hundred milligrams correct
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how is your diet
[patient] kinda the same as my exercise decent could be better
[doctor] alright and okay not a problem so what is your do you are you measuring your calories at all looking at your macros are you just eating what you feel like
[patient] yeah just trying to watch what i eat more than anything but nothing specific
[doctor] okay and are you do you know if you're particularly focused on your salt like is it like a low salt diet
[patient] no just trying to watch my carbs a little bit more but not counting or anything
[doctor] alright so like is it a specific diet i just wan na make sure like are you on like the keto diet
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam as i mentioned before your blood pressure is a little high as i listen to your heart i do like it's got a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur when i listen to your lungs they sound clear bilaterally i would like to look at your knee though so when i press here on the outside does it hurt
[patient] little bit
[doctor] okay and then when i press on the inside does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright can you bend your knee and straighten it
[patient] i can i think that's all i can i can bend
[doctor] mm-hmm alright so are you having problems walking can you bear weight
[patient] i can but i have a little bit of a limp
[doctor] okay so do you mind getting up and walking for me really quickly alright so i do notice that there is a slight gait like there is a small sorry you are correcting you do have a limp i i am a little worried about that but it's probably it's probably the superficial when i'm looking at your knee i do notice some like ecchymosis and edema that just means bruising and swelling along the lateral aspect of your knee i do n't notice any effusion and it looks like you have a decent range of motion but i do understand that you know you are experiencing pain with some movement okay i'm gon na go ahead and order an x-ray and when you come back we can have that discussion alright so i reviewed the results of your right knee x-ray which showed no evidence of fracture or bony abnormality so let's talk about my assessment and plan alright so for your first problem of right knee pain i think you have a lateral a lateral ligament strain i wan na prescribe some meloxicam which is gon na be fifteen milligrams daily for pain and swelling i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen the muscles around the area and to prevent further injury if you're still having pain we can do further imaging imaging but like this is a common injury that tends to heal on its own for your second problem with hypertension i wan na continue the lisinopril at twenty milligrams and order an echo i am concerned that we might not be getting your blood pressure to where we need it to be so we might have to do some medication modification for your third problem with diabetes i wan na order an a1c i know that you said you have been measuring your blood sugars but i think this would give us a better image of what's been happening long term and i also wan na order a lipid panel in case we need to make any adjustments to that medication as well do you have any questions

aci_D2N112_nan,"[doctor] hey matthew i see here that you've had some back pain for a while and your pcp sent you over to see me how're you doing today
[patient] pretty good i'm feeling pretty good do n't like the weather you know i've been sitting in the waiting area for you know thirty minutes and that definitely makes the symptoms worse
[doctor] okay well first of all i i agree with you the weather has kinda been all over the place been hot and been cold and and and now it seems like we've had a week of pretty chilly weather hopefully that changes pretty soon so tell me a little bit about when when your back pain started and and and what happened there
[patient] well you wan na hear the long story or kind of the short story because my back has been bothering me for a long time
[doctor] so let's do let's do the reader's digestive version
[patient] well i ca n't i ca n't really tie my shoes you know standing really makes it bad you know when i go to the mall it really really i do n't know all i i've just been bedridden
[doctor] okay and i know it got real bad about a month ago that's what the report here from the pcp said but can you tell me exactly where the pain is in your lower back can you kinda point to where that's at
[patient] yeah it's right here and you know like thirty years ago when i fell off the roof it was really really bothersome they they said maybe there was a fracture or something and you know i do n't know i just could n't play football and then i had to you know kinda try to take care of myself but you know it's it's been really bad for about a month
[doctor] okay and then do you still have that pain that radiates down your left leg sometimes
[patient] yeah of course yeah it goes all the way through here
[doctor] okay and then so it looks like you pointed to your lower back area and then pointed down through your hip and down into your to your left leg can you describe that pain for me
[patient] it's like a electrical tooth ache and it it it goes down the whole leg
[doctor] okay and can you rate that pain for me right now zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in in your life
[patient] right now it's less bad i did n't take my medications because i wanted you to see me as as i am but it's six out of ten but when it gets really bad i'd say it's thirteen out of ten
[doctor] okay and anything that you do make it feel better you mentioned that you know sometimes sitting or laying down anything there make that better
[patient] yeah like i said it the only thing that seems to make it better is laying down
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know standing walking seems to make it worse coughing sneezing makes it worse and you know i had a friend that saw you and you know you burned some nerves or something like that and so i was just seeing if there was something that you could do to get me out of this pain and hopefully you can do it today
[doctor] okay and then any numbness or tingling in in your lower extremities or any weakness there in your legs
[patient] you know it it's my back that's weak and my legs are weak both of them you know coughing sneezing seem to make it worse so sorry i'm just trying to be like a typical patient because most patients they do n't answer the darn questions so you you know all this time i still have n't gotten a chief complaint out of them so i love the way that you're trying to redirect and so you know what your doctor said you had back pain and leg pain but for me the most important thing for me to capture is that it's in the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe and so i need them to be able to give me a perfect sort of root signature so i can hone in is that four five disk seen on the mri really significant or is it on the opposite side but again i'm sorry i'm purposely trying to be in a difficult patient because some of these patients he asked them fifty different questions they wo n't answer any of them so anyway sorry about well
[doctor] that's okay
[patient] to explain but this is what i deal with every single day
[doctor] absolutely
[patient] lot of pain yeah you know what my pain is eight out of ten it goes in the back goes into the hip side of the leg side of the calf goes to the big toe my foot kinda drags when i walk i've been having to use a cane nothing seems to make it better and but very few patients will give you the perfect history and most people will start talking about you know when something happened or go back to thirty years ago and you wan na redirect them to their current symptom but the patients wo n't rarely ever tell you what the chief complaint is you you got ta pull it out of them
[doctor] so let's take a a quick look at you here okay let's do a physical exam real quick so your vitals look good which is a good thing now on your back exam i do n't see any bony abnormalities no redness or no and no bruising present now do you have pain when i press here
[patient] no it's right here
[doctor] okay so positive for pain to palpation at the l4 vertebrae and if you bend forward do you have pain there
[patient] it hurts all the time especially sitting in these run office desks
[doctor] okay so you are positive for pain with flexion and extension of your back i'm going to go ahead and test the strength of your legs now push out against my hands for me please
[patient] okay that's it that's all i got
[doctor] alright so four out of five strength in the left and five out of five on the right does look like that reflexes are brisk and motor and sensory is intact in both lower extremities i do wan na review the results of your mri the mri shows a disk herniation at the level of l4 l5 vertebrae and it is associated with some nerve root impingement and what that means is the nerve is being compressed by that herniation so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for the diagnosis of of acute disk herniation at l4 l5 with that nerve root impingement that's causing that pain down your leg and your lower back pain now i know you've tried nsaids in the past without relief and you've done some pt so what i'm going to do is i'm gon na recommend an epidural steroid injection and we're gon na do that today for you if you agree to it what that means is gon na place some anti-inflammatory medication right at the spot of inflammation and once that's in place i wan na refer you back to pt and we wan na strengthen that area mkay you're young and otherwise healthy i think you'll do well but it can take about two to three weeks for that injection really to take full effect so then i want you to see pt and i want you to see me again in about a month are you okay with that treatment plan
[patient] sure sounds good

aci_D2N114_nan,"[doctor] alright
[patient] good morning Julie how are you doing today
[doctor] i'm doing okay i'm just a little nervous about what's been going on with my headaches
[patient] okay so i know you were sent here by your your pcp what was your understanding of why you were sent here
[doctor] yeah so i actually have been someone who been struggling with headaches for years now ever since i was a teenager and they used to be around my when i would have my menstrual my menses but as i got older i noticed that it has been with that and also i can get it when i'm really stressed but recently and why i went to her is because my headaches have been getting a lot more they've just been happening a lot more frequently and a lot more severe
[patient] okay can you tell me a little bit about them what how do they how do they feel when they come on
[doctor] so they say mostly on my right side and it even seems like it's like behind my eye and it just like this pulsing like this really bad pulsing sensation
[patient] okay do you notice these any activities or time of the day that makes them worse i know you said they they seem to get worse around your menstrual periods but is there any time of the day or that makes them worse
[doctor] i i have noticed that you know i've been trying to exercise more in order to lose weight but i ca n't even really exercise for very long because i start of as soon as i start to jog i my headaches the headaches come back on a lot worse so i notice it when i'm exercising
[patient] okay and do you seem to have any other symptoms when you get these headaches i've been having a ringing in my ears for a few months now and then what really scared me is that now i'm starting to get some blurred vision it's not all the time but it it will come and go but some blurred like on the
[doctor] in my on the side of my vision
[patient] okay okay and have you experienced any numbness or tingling to your hands or feet or your face
[doctor] no i have n't
[patient] okay so you you like to run a lot what kind of do you do you use a a good shoe you know what kind of shoes do you use for your running
[doctor] yeah i yeah i i'm starting to get back into it i'm a big new balance person in asics so yeah those are the two brands i like to wear yeah so right now i'm using asics
[patient] okay yeah i like to run too and i use nike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i used to get tumor guy but i i really kinda moved over to nike
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] that's good you know it is running is a great exercise
[doctor] it is
[patient] so have you had any let's get back to the exam here have you had a recent mri of your brain i saw one from a few years ago but as doctor white said anything about getting a more a recent mri
[doctor] yeah she was gon na put one in but she wanted me to see you first and urgently so they have n't called me yet for the mri
[patient] okay so that's good we i think we'll we will follow up with that mri but let's go ahead and take a do a quick physical exam here i reviewed your vitals that the the assistant collected when you came in and everything there looks good including your blood pressure you know with symptoms like that that's one of those things that i'd be concerned about
[doctor] okay
[patient] now on your heart exam it sounds like it's normal sinus rhythm with no murmurs rubs or gallops so that's good as i listen i'm gon na go ahead and look here in your eyes the funduscopic exam shows papilledema and that's just some of swelling behind there in the eye and this let me do a a neurological exam this will take a few minutes you get up to follow my instructions as we go through that okay on neurological exam your cranial nerves one through twelve are intact including a normal cranial reflex and just went to watch you walk across the room here
[doctor] okay turn around come back and okay so on musculoskeletal exam your gait is normal
[doctor] okay go ahead sorry
[patient] that's okay for your first problem your headaches your symptoms are concerning for what we call idiopathic intracranial hypertension and this is a condition that that you have increased pressure in the in your head in your brain without any known cause for it now patient also presents with often present with symptoms such as yours you know headaches worsening with activity ringing in the ears changes in your vision so i'm i'm pretty confident that that's what we're having here now why we get concerned is if the pressure continues to increase this can lead to some permanent changes in your vision so i i do wan na get a a few more tests just so we can confirm that diagnosis and the first one that we just talked about is an mri i think it's really important to get that to check for any other condition that could be contributing to your symptoms now once i have that result i'm gon na be doing also doing a spinal tap which will help me evaluate the pressure in the brain and it can also help you feel better if you do have an increased pressure by taking the decreasing the amount of that pressure just by taking a a a little bit of fluid off of that and lastly i want you to be seen by a neuro-ophthalmologist for a complete eye exam now i i know that sounds like a lot of information but i think it's really important we get that accomplished do you have any questions for me
[doctor] yeah that is a lot and so i i'm sure i'll have more that comes up but so let's say we do all this test and it confirms what you're saying does that mean was i referred to you because that means i will need surgery
[patient] not necessarily if you have idiopathic intracranial hypertension there are number of medications that we can try to help decrease that pressure in your brain and this will also help you have less headaches when you exercise as exercise and weight loss are also an important part of the treatment
[doctor] okay alright alright and i'll probably add something about so is this something i'll be doing soon is this all things i'll be doing this week
[patient] yeah that's a great question here i i'm gon na go ahead and we're gon na for the mri i'll have to get a preapproval from your insurance company i will work on that my my my team in the front office will get that preapproved and then once that's done we'll call you to help schedule that mri

[patient] i heard the chiropractors will shake they work
[doctor] i do understand that some people have like reservations about going to the chiropractor but you know we do have some good ones that have like longstanding histories and patients that have had positive results from the experience but if you if you do n't like the idea of that we can consider other options like that rehab and physical therapy

aci_D2N116_nan,"[doctor] hey hi bobby how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing good how are you
[doctor] i'm doing fine so i understand you're here having some left or some right shoulder pain that you've had for a few weeks now
[patient] yeah it was i was doing some work in my backyard and a lot of different projects going on and you know i was obviously sore all over the next couple of days but my my right shoulder just keeps on bothering me and it keeps it's just really sore and it just has n't been going away
[doctor] okay so have you had ever had any pain in that shoulder before
[patient] a little bit i you know i i hurt that same shoulder because it's my my dominant hand my right hand i hurt it playing baseball when i was younger
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so
[doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not
[patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it
[doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go
[patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain
[doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also
[patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so
[doctor] okay
[patient] of course
[doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that
[patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it
[doctor] okay and does that seem to help or
[patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit
[doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and
[patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift
[doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or
[patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of
[doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the left shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan
[patient] no that sounds good
[doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay
[patient] sounds great
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] thanks
[doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or
[patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but
[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that

[patient] no it does n't
[doctor] okay and what would you say the pain is you know on a scale of zero to ten
[patient] it's probably an eight when i'm just when i'm using it even if it's to get something out of the cupboard and it's a three when i'm just kinda resting
[doctor] hmmm okay and do you would you say it's a sharp pain stabbing pain aching throbbing how would you describe it
[patient] all of the above shooting stabbing very sharp
[doctor] okay alright and you let's see other than the the tennis you know increase in tennis activity you have n't had any trauma recently falling on it or you know felt a pop anywhere or anything like that have you
[patient] not that i can recall
[doctor] okay and and you said it's it's worse with movement better with rest is there anything else that makes it makes it worse or makes it better
[patient] i've taken some tylenol and ibuprofen but as soon as those wear off it it comes right back so they do n't really help
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i did try a little ice i probably should ice it more but i did n't notice it helping much
[doctor] okay okay alright yeah well i definitely i'm glad you're getting some exercise now that's good for your diabetes and all that and out there playing tennis kinda back back to the back to the old days for you right did do i recall that were n't you a big tennis player back in the day like state champ in high school or something
[patient] yeah yeah that was a hundred years ago i ca n't i i try to play like that and i ca n't i ca n't do that anymore but yeah a good memory that's a that's a good memory
[doctor] now
[patient] kind of a tennis guy too right did you see the the australia open
[doctor] i did i did yeah that was that was crazy that was a great tournament what a what a finish unbelievable
[patient] yeah hey did you see the masters i know you're a golfer
[doctor] yeah yeah yeah i do n't get out as often as i as as i like to but but the masters yeah that was that was amazing that was lot of fun to lot of fun did you catch it too
[patient] i did
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] but that's it was i i could n't believe tiger went out there of course he did
[doctor] right
[patient] it was cool to see nothing
[doctor] yep yep agreed agreed and so well listen we'll we'll hopefully get you feeling better here and get you back out on the court and out on the course and we'll talk about that but let's let me ask you about your diabetes a little bit a little bit here so how have your blood sugars been running mark have they been what in the low one hundreds two hundreds where are they
[patient] they are like one fifty one sixty you know we just had easter and my kids got a whole bunch of candies so i keep eating that
[doctor] hmmm okay yeah yeah understood so those cadboy eggs they'll get you every time too right
[patient] yes
[doctor] boy my gosh yeah those are the best so those are those are deadly do n't tell my cardiologist so okay so listen you know i see that we have you on metformin five hundred milligrams once a day no actually last visit we increased it so i've got you on metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day correct you're still taking that
[patient] yes twice a day
[doctor] okay and but your blood sugars are a bit off you know maybe those the cadberry eggs so how about your asthma how has that been doing you know have you had any asthma attacks you're still taking flovent twice a day and the albuterol as needed
[patient] yeah knock on wood i my asthma is pretty much under control
[doctor] okay excellent excellent alright and i recall you know just kinda review a few things i i think you've got an allergy to penicillin is that correct
[patient] that's correct yes
[doctor] okay and then you you know your surgical history you had your your gallbladder out what about ten years ago i think by doctor nelson correct
[patient] yes that's right
[doctor] okay and then let's go ahead and examine you alright so mark your exam is pretty much you know for the most part normal with a few exceptions on your heart exam you still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur and that's unchanged from prior exam we're watching that and so that just means i hear some some heart sounds as your heart is beating there i'm not too concerned about it as as that's not changed otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and your physical exam otherwise on your musculoskeletal exam on your right elbow you do have moderate lateral epicondylar tenderness of the right elbow and how about when i move this when i move your elbow like this does that hurt you
[patient] kills
[doctor] okay sorry about that so you've got moderate pain with passive range of motion of the right elbow there is no palpable joint effusion and now what if i press against your wrist like so does that hurt you
[patient] yeah it hurts a little bit
[doctor] okay alright sorry so that's you have mild pain with resisted extension of the right wrist as well okay otherwise normal unremarkable exam and let's talk about your results now so your right elbow x-ray today shows no acute fracture or other bony abnormality so that's good there's no malalignment or sign of joint effusion and otherwise it's a normal right elbow x-ray so that's reassuring okay and hey you know i meant to ask you you know and do you have any history of fever recently you know along with the elbow pain you had noticed a fever
[patient] no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay great excellent alright so tell you what let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan here so for your first problem my assessment is is that you have acute lateral epicondylitis of your right elbow and this is also known as tennis elbow go figure right so this is due to overuse likely the increase in your your tennis activity which normally would be good but maybe we're overdoing it a little bit so i have a few recommendations i'd like you to rest your right arm as much as you can i want you to stop tennis for the next four to six weeks and please avoid repetitive stress in that right arm as well i want you to ice that right elbow for twenty minutes at least three times per day and this should reduce the pain and inflammation and then i'm also going to give you a brace for your right forearm and my nurse will give this to you before you leave that should help with the discomfort okay in that right elbow i will also write you a prescription for ultram and this should help with the pain i'll write you a prescription ultram fifty milligrams once per day that should help with your elbow pain so then i wan na see you in follow-up in four weeks and so we'll reevaluate your elbow at that time and if you we'll consider some additional imaging if needed possibly a physical therapy referral depending on how you're doing mkay now for your second problem of diabetes type two my assessment is is that your blood sugar is a little bit out of control mkay so we need to make some adjustments i'm going to increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice per day and i want you to check your blood sugar twice daily for the next two weeks and then let me know how your blood sugar is running and we can make some additional adjustments if needed but i will increase your metformin to one thousand milligrams twice a day now i'm going to also order a hemoglobin a1c level and and a cbc blood test today and and so we'll check those results the hemoglobin a1c and the cbc and then i'm going to also check a chem-12 blood test as well and now for your third problem of the mild acute intermittent asthma you my assessment is that it really remains under good control so let's keep you on that flovent and the albuterol no changes there and you can use those as tolerated it does look like you need a refill on your albuterol so i'm gon na write you a prescription for a refill of the albuterol and you can pick that up at your pharmacy as well so how does that all sound any questions for me
[patient] it sounds pretty good i ca n't believe it's just tennis elbow feel like a looser coming in here but it's okay i get it
[doctor] yeah yeah well
[patient] i'm not i'm not young anymore
[doctor] yeah well let's let's keep you active but take a break for a bit and let's ease back into it okay so it's great to see you and i'll see you back in four weeks let me know if you have other problems in the meantime

[patient] okay
[doctor] so i also see you're here for you have a past medical history of of hypertension and when you came in today your blood pressure was a little bit high it was a one fifty over ninety i'm reading here in your chart you're on two point five of norvasc
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] now have you been taking that regularly
[patient] i have but at home my blood pressure is always great
[doctor] okay maybe you have a little white coat syndrome some of my patients do have it i have it myself and i'm a provider so i definitely understand yeah i know we we talked about last time you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking those about two to three times a week so what have those readings been i'm usually like one thirty to one forty over sixty to seventy
[patient] okay
[doctor] that's that's that's not too bad i think when you first came in you were around like one eighty so it seems to be that that norvasc is is working for you how about your diet i know you were having a little issue eating some fast food and and cakes and cookies and have you been able to get that under control
[patient] yeah it's hard to give up the fast food altogether because it's a lot of on the go you know
[doctor] okay so do you think you would be able to get that under control by yourself or would you do you think you would need help with that maybe a dietitian be able to help you out
[patient] yeah i do n't know i do n't know if i can make another appointment i just add to the extra
[doctor] okay
[patient] less time to make food so
[doctor] yeah yeah definitely understand
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] alright yeah so i mean that's one thing we just got ta work one is your diet we try to keep you at least just twenty three hundred milligrams or less of sodium per day i know that's hard for a lot of salads and stuff i know it's hard for lot of people especially with all like the the prepackage foods we have around today so that's definitely something we we should work on
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so let's also look here you have a history of diabetes and so you're on that five hundred milligrams of metformin daily now have you been taking that as well
[patient] yeah i take my metformin
[doctor] okay

[doctor] so what have your blood sugars been running daily
[patient] well i do n't check it very often
[doctor] okay
[patient] but i think they've been pretty good
[doctor] okay so i'm looking here i think last after your last visit you got a1c now was six . seven so it's a little bit high it's gone down a little bit since you were first diagnosed with the type two diabetes a year ago so i'm glad we're making progress with that as well alright so i'm just gon na do a quick physical exam on you before i do just wan na make sure are you having any chest pain today
[patient] no
[doctor] alright any any belly pain

aci_D2N119_nan,"[doctor] hey betty how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing okay i just been really frustrated because with my asthma and it just seems like i can never catch a break never get better i'm always it seems like i'm always coughing and wheezing
[doctor] i'm sorry to hear that what normally triggers your asthma type symptoms
[patient] i find that it's really really when i get sick if i get sick with a cold i almost always know that my asthma is going to flare i did notice one time though that when i went to my aunt's house i i had a flare afterwards and i think it's because of her cat so i try to avoid going there and i have n't really had an issue since
[doctor] okay so now you mentioned that that happens somewhat a lot how frequently does this occur that you have these breathing type problems
[patient] it seems like it happens really every month or every other month for the past six months i usually end up going to the urgent care a lot and get or my primary care doctor and so sometimes they'll give me antibiotics sometimes i'll get steroids one time it was so bad i actually ended up going to the emergency department
[doctor] wow that that can be a little bit scary so you mentioned that your primary care provider or the urgent care provider gave you medications what medications are you using for your asthma right now
[patient] i have two inhalers one but i really just use one of them it's a blue one that seems like the only inhaler that helps me the other one when i when i try to use it it does n't work
[doctor] okay so do you think that's the albuterol inhaler is it do you remember the name like ventolin or
[patient] yes yes that's the name of it
[doctor] is that it okay alright and then how often do you feel like you need to use that
[patient] i would say like almost everyday i feel like i'm using my inhaler because i'm always coughing and wheezing and a couple of times a night i'll wake up as a couple times a week i'll end up waking up needing to use my inhaler as well
[doctor] okay and then when you use it at that time does it help
[patient] it does
[doctor] okay and how many walk me through how you use that you just wake up and you take one puff or is it two puffs
[patient] yeah i take i usually take two puffs
[doctor] okay but then you get enough relief that you can go back to sleep
[patient] yeah for the most part
[doctor] okay now have you ever needed to be hospitalized due to your asthma symptoms you mentioned you've had to go to the er
[patient] yeah for only once i can think of when i was young i think like around eight years old i had to be hospitalized but nothing since then
[doctor] okay i do wan na take a little bit of a a deeper dive here into your er and urgent care visits can you tell me a little bit more about those
[patient] yeah i feel like i've had several i do n't remember the exact number but i've had several this past year they almost always have to start me on prednisone
[doctor] okay like a prednisone taper pack that type of thing
[patient] yeah yeah sometimes they'll just give me like like a like a large dose over five days
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then sometimes they make me take less and less and less so the over like nine or ten days
[doctor] okay so both the dosepak and then also the high dose as well okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then when was your last exacerbation
[patient] probably about a month ago
[doctor] okay so just out of curiosity you mentioned that you you have trouble when you go over to your aunt's house because of your cat now i see here that you really like to go outside and walk and do those type of things do you have any other type of issues whenever you you go outside any any seasonal allergies or anything like that
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay so you do n't have any history of seasonal allergies which is good so it looks like here that you put down that you enjoyed hiking so you do n't have any trouble getting out and going hiking and and have you tried the new trails there behind behind the wreck center
[patient] yeah i'm really excited to i mean i have to be careful because i you know with my coughing my wheezing but i'm really i'm looking forward to getting better so i can really start hiking again
[doctor] okay now i really need you to be truthful when you answer these next questions this is important for taking a good history do you smoke any type of cigarette or tobacco product and have you ever smoked or do you smoke marijuana on a regular basis
[patient] no i've never smoked and i do n't vape either or yeah i do n't smoke cigarettes or marijuana
[doctor] okay and then you said you do n't vape so no vaping or e-cigarette use at all
[patient] hmmm hmmm
[doctor] okay and then are you routinely in an area where there is a lot of airborne particular like smoking in bars or around any type of of you know like race tracks or anything like that
[patient] sometimes i go to the bars with some friends and yeah the smoking does irritate me
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i do n't try to go there often
[doctor] okay thank you for sharing that with me so if it's okay with you i'd like to go ahead and do a quick physical exam
[patient] okay

[patient] so i've tried some physical therapy before and so when it gets really bad they've even had to prescribe some strong pain medications for me but that was only temporary and they even mentioned surgery to me in the past but i really would like to avoid surgery
[doctor] okay sure so tell me what is your day like
[patient] my day so i try to be as active as i can but of course it's been difficult with my back pain and so because of that i have gained some weight over the past years
[doctor] okay alright well i'm sorry to hear that i know that you used to like playing golf
[patient] yeah i and you know golf is relatively new for me i've been trying to get into it but this has definitely set me back
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry yep probably now at the peak of you know just learning it and being able to do more with it this comes and this happens right
[patient] exactly
[doctor] well let's see what we can do for you here so you can go out into the you know the golf course again now do you tell me do you have any family members with spine conditions
[patient] no i ca n't recall any family members
[doctor] okay alright and do you smoke
[patient] not now i i quit about twenty years ago
[doctor] okay alright well alright well i like to do a quick physical exam on you here
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na go ahead here i reviewed your vitals and they overall look pretty good so that's a good sign now on your musculoskeletal back exam there is no overlying erythema and that just means redness or ecchymosis and that just means bruising of the skin now there is midline tenderness at l4 l5 disk space with right-sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness so do me a favor and i'm gon na just have you you know bend forward and straighten up a bit
[patient] okay that's painful
[doctor] sorry so definitely some pain with lumbar flexion and supine straight leg test is positive so on your neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome okay and i'm just gon na take a look at your knees here real quick and then your your ankles so patellar and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so good now i reviewed the results of your mri and it shows disk herniation with nerve impingement so let me tell you about my assessment and plan here larry so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain so based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri results your symptoms are consistent with an l4 l5 herniated disk with radicul radiculopathy so this means that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves and that's why you feel that tingling in your leg so yeah yeah so i am recommending a spinal injection with a strong inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid and what i do is i will inject the corticosteroid into that lumbar spine under fluoroscopy which you can think of you know an x-ray to help localize to the exact area of your pain now this should this should help the inflammation that is causing the pain so what do you think about that
[patient] is there something i'm gon na have to do all the time
[doctor] well you know patients are different so what we do is we will monitor you and we see how you respond to the injection and the patient's intervals can be different as well but we usually do not do more than four times a year
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright and it's not a long procedure it's it's relatively quick and common and you should be out of the office within an hour
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright sounds good
[doctor] alright well let's go ahead and get you started on the first one today if that works for you if not we'll get you scheduled to start your first injection

[patient] it's my right knee
[doctor] your right knee okay and i know that it sounds like you were on a motor boat as you were you know water skiing but did you hear anything pop or feel anything pop when it happened
[patient] no it just felt like something stretched and then it swelled up some afterwards
[doctor] okay and were you i assume that you were were you able to get out of the water by yourself or did you need some assistance
[patient] i was able to get out but it was very sore to climb up and you know any kind of squatting or bending is really pretty sore
[doctor] yeah okay and have you ever injured this knee before
[patient] no that was the first time
[doctor] that was the first time okay where do you have a boat what lake do you have it on lake
[patient] lake martin
[doctor] okay nice and so you're a frequent water skier
[patient] yeah i try to go every weekend when we can
[doctor] that's nice very very good are you looking forward to spring are you a baseball fan are you excited by opening day
[patient] no i'm not a baseball fan but i love spring and chicken time of year launds of outdoor activities nice nice i'm i'm not really a baseball fan either but my husband makes me watch the the meds all the time and they lose all the time so he is always upset so so anyway
[doctor] yeah right so how about your high blood pressure how are you doing with that are you taking your blood pressure medication like i asked
[patient] i'm taking it everyday and i check my blood pressure at home and it's been about one twenty five over eighty most of the days
[doctor] nice okay so i believe we have you on lisinopril about twenty milligrams a day any side effects from that that you're noticing
[patient] not that i know of it's been a good medicine for me and i do n't have any trouble with it
[doctor] okay great alright and since you had this knee pain any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] no just the swelling and the pain
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] i i took some aleve twice a day some over the counter aleve twice a day
[doctor] okay and
[patient] putting a cold pack on it
[doctor] okay and has that helped at all
[patient] yeah that's helped a fair amount it's still pretty sore though
[doctor] okay alright well let's see have you ever had any surgeries before let me just think any surgeries i do n't see any in your in your record here
[patient] i had my tonsils out
[doctor] okay you had your tonsils out okay alright well let me go ahead i wan na do a just a quick physical exam i'm gon na go ahead and be calling out some of my clinical exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your vital signs here in the office it does look like you're doing a really good job managing your blood pressure your blood pressure is up is about one twenty over seventy seven today here in the office and that's with you probably in a little bit of pain so that's good and on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any lymphadenopathy on your heart exam your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some ecchymosis some edema there is an effusion present does it hurt when i press
[patient] yeah that's sore
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation of the right medial knee there is i'm just gon na bend your knee in all sorts of directions here does that hurt
[patient] yeah do n't do that anymore
[doctor] alright the patient has decreased range of motion there is a negative varus and valgus test there is a negative lachman sign there is a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulse there is otherwise no lower extremity edema so what does that what does that mean kenneth so that so that means that you essentially i agree with you you had quite quite an injury to your knee and you do have a little bit of fluid in your knee there and just some inflammation which i think we need to talk about okay so i wan na go ahead and just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so for your first problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have what we call a a medial collateral ligament strain you know i wan na go ahead and just order an x-ray of your right knee just to make sure that we're not missing any broken bones which i do n't think we are but what's good about this particular injury is that people typically heal quite well from this and they typically do n't need surgery we can just go ahead and refer you to physical therapy to to strengthen those muscles around your knee so that you do n't have another injury and i wan na go ahead and just prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and that will help take down the swelling and help with some of the pain and you only have to take it once a day and it wo n't really cause any upset stomach or anything like that do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah if i start that medicine today am i going to be able to ski tomorrow because we got a a big weekend plan
[doctor] i would say i would like you to rest your knee i i think that my concern is that if you go skiing again and you fall that you might injure your knee even more so i think you'll recover from this injury right now but i do n't want you to injure it anymore so i would rest it for a little while at least until we have the results of the x-ray and that type of thing okay for your second problem of your hypertension i wan na just go ahead and continue on lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na just go ahead and order an a lipid panel just to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and then i'm just looking through your health record and it looks like you're due for a tetanus shot so we'll go ahead and just give you a a tetanus shot for a from a health maintenance perspective any other questions

[patient] well it's just been something that i have noticed over the last you know four to five weeks it seems like something is always stuck in my throat and you know just i kinda go about my day and it kinda bothers me you know a little bit sometimes a little painful and when i try to eat it just seems like i have to i do n't know when it's something solid i kinda have to wash it down on occasion i i've never really fully choked but i have to admit that i've thought about potentially choking
[doctor] okay and is it seem to be stuck in your throat or does it seem to go in your lungs area or are you coughing with this at all or just mostly when you're swallowing

[patient] i get there now every once in a while you know the lower numbers a little bit you know higher but it's not you know usually it's either close or or on on range

[doctor] absolutely okay totally understand that glad to hear that you're back out on the court playing with your son how is he doing by the way
[patient] he is doing great he is doing great i mean you know he is a big step kurry fan so he likes to keep up shots from from way out past the three point line and he is only ten and tiny so it's it's not a good idea for him to do that but he is doing really well and i'm just happy he's tried every sport and basketball's really what took so i'm just really happy that he has a sport and loves and couple of his buddies playing to lead with him so it's just makes me happy that he's found something he really enjoys

[doctor] tell me what's been going on yeah so i've got this stabbing shooting pain i've had for a while you know and it it especially right here in my right face right in that cheek bone area it's sometimes it gets super hot i've had it for i think a couple of months now and i went to my family doctor and they said i should come see you
[patient] okay great i would like to ask you a little bit more about that
[doctor] had in your face do you remember how long that you had it probably for about two or three months just just came on slowly i started noticing it but now it's i have episodes where just shooting stabbing kind of a pain in my right cheek bone right face area
[patient] mm-hmm do you have any sensory loss meaning like numbness or tingling in that part of your face
[doctor] not that i've noticed no okay do you have any symptoms like this anywhere else on your face including the other side of your face
[patient] no it's just on the right side mostly not on the left side just on the right side of my face
[doctor] have you noticed any weakness on that side of the face like when you smile or while you're doing other things any weakness there not really i mean i've i've i've tried to you know when i smile my smile seems equal on both sides my eyes i do n't have any weakness there my vision seems to be unchanged but just this stabbing severe pain it's just like excruciating pain that i get sometimes does it happen on its own or there are certain things that trigger it
[patient] sometimes if i'm if certain temperatures seem to trigger it sometimes or if it's super where it's cold i get a trigger sometimes
[doctor] sometimes certain kind of sensory outside of the wind sometimes that seems to trigger it but that's about it
[patient] okay and anything that you've done to to that helps for a little bit when you
[doctor] pain excess
[patient] you know i've tried ibuprofen and motrin that had really has n't helped it just comes on suddenly and then it's kinda stabbing excruciating pain i've tried rubbing some you know some tiger balm on it that did n't work
[doctor] but that's you know so i i went to my family doctor and he said you know i really need to see a neurosurgeon
[patient] got it how long do these episodes last these pain
[doctor] you know it can last for anywhere from a few minutes to sometimes about an hour but generally generally a few minutes
[patient] any history of something like multiple sclerosis or any brain tumors that you know
[doctor] no nothing like that alright any other kinda headache symptoms that have anything like you had migraines or anything related to the headaches i mean i get occasional headaches but not really i do n't have a history of migraines but i occasionally get headaches like everybody else i take some tylenol that usually goes away but this is different
[patient] how severe is the pain on a scale of one to ten
[doctor] when it comes on it's like a ten it's like somebody is stabbing you with an ice pick and but usually you know after a few minutes usually it goes away but sometimes it can last up to an hour great so mister i would like to do a physical exam if that's okay with you
[patient] sure
[doctor] i would like you to follow my finger here and i see that you're following my finger in in both directions can you show me your teeth
[patient] that looks nice and symmetric i'm gon na rub my fingers next to your ear can you hear that
[doctor] yep
[patient] you can hear it on the other side as well
[doctor] yep
[patient] okay
[doctor] i'm gon na take this cotton tape and run it along the side of your face can you feel that okay
[patient] yeah it's a little bit numb on my right side not so much on my left side
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na use this little needle here and i'm gon na poke here and i wan na see if you feel like it's being sharp or dull on that part of your face does that feel different or normal
[patient] it feels a little bit dull on my left on my right side my left side it feels sharp
[doctor] alright good well i had a chance to look at your mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] and i looked at your mri and it appears to have small blood vessel that is abutting and perhaps even pinching the trigeminal nerve the trigeminal nerve is nerve that comes from the brainstem that goes out to the face and provides the sensory inflammation from the face and you may have a condition called trigeminal neuralgia
[patient] okay
[doctor] where the nerve compression causes this kind of shooting electrical pain in the face how do we treat it
[patient] well the first line would be to try some medications usually we start with medications that are called gabapentin
[doctor] or tegretol these are medications that really help reduce the excitability of the nerve
[patient] okay
[doctor] most people can get the pain control with that but there are some people where the medications are n't gon na be enough and in that situation we would consider surgery i would n't i would n't recommend that now we usually try the medications first
[patient] for considering a surgery to decompress the nerve the root cause of the problem is the compression of the blood vessel against the nerve
[doctor] okay so we should be tried which one would you recommend the tegretol or yeah i think we could start with the tegretol to start with i just want to make sure that you understand some of the potential side effects that you can have with this
[patient] sure
[doctor] it's always a little bit of trial and error to figure out what the right dosing that would work for you but some common side effects can include you know memory loss tingling imbalance some people can actually have like dermatologic
[patient] skin reaction to this medication and particularly people who have eustachian descent so that we may do some genetic testing just to make sure that it will be safe for you
[doctor] okay sounds good let's do it
[patient] okay so i will prescribe that for you and then we will see how that goes and if your pain continues we can talk about different surgical options to treat the pain
[doctor] yeah i think i would like to try the tegretol first and if that does n't work then i can come back and so once should i come back and just to kinda check back with you and see if you know if it's had enough time for a fact or not
[patient] i think one month would be a great time to follow up
[doctor] okay sounds good so if you want to send that prescription over to my pharmacy that would be fine and then why do n't i come back in about a month and we'll go from there
[patient] great i'll see you then

[doctor] okay alright and so we will be able to check on that when you take your medication so before you take your medication rather like are you able to move like are you experiencing any stiffness
[patient] yes but it hurts
[doctor] okay it hurts what kind of pain is it sharp is it dull is it throbbing
[patient] it's the sharp incapacitating pain i ca n't work
[doctor] wow okay are you having any headaches

[patient] my left arm and my right leg
[doctor] okay any spasms
[patient] of course
[doctor] okay where
[patient] my body hurts i told you my neck hurts
[doctor] okay so i no i'm absolutely i wan na make sure that we are gon na give you the medication that works like the best for you so i'm sorry if these questions seem like frustrating i would just wan na make sure that i understand what the problem is so
[patient] i saw pamela and doctor collins's office she's much nicer than you know
[doctor] i mean okay so you know what like maybe maybe pamela would be better like we could maybe talk talk about a referral if that would make you more comfortable
[patient] my lawyer told me to come here
[doctor] then you're stuck with me okay i'm so sorry but here it's we're gon na try and make it as good as possible alright so last thing i do wan na do my physical exam alright and i need you to let me know as as much as you as much as you can verbalize right so when i push here in the middle of your neck on top of the bone does it hurt
[patient] yes yes
[doctor] okay alright sorry what about on the side does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on palpation both on the bony process and on the muscle can you move your neck from side to side can you move your neck can you swive it side to side no no alright so i'm i'm seeing i'm seeing some range of movement moderate range of movement that's fine okay i so when can you bend your neck forward that that's your whole body just just the neck are you capable of bending up
[patient] really hurts it really hurts
[doctor] okay it really hurts to bend forward and backwards okay alright so i'm just gon na make a little note here i do n't i do n't see any bruising i'm not noticing any swelling there is i i do n't see any laceration what
[patient] just sometimes it bruises
[doctor] okay sometimes alright that's fine i i just i'm not seeing one here today so that's okay alright so with that being said i do wan na ask have you been experiencing any fatigue are you tired
[patient] well since the accident yes
[doctor] okay alright just making sure okay so this is what this is my assessment and plan this is what we are gon na do i want to be able to like we had you do an x-ray before you came in here and looking at it i'm not noticing any fracture that's a really good sign considering how many car accidents we've been in lately
[patient] it hurts it hurts
[doctor] absolutely no i we're gon na address the pain so for my first so looking at your imaging results though i'm not seeing a fracture that's a great sign so for your first diagnosis i'm gon na say that you have what is called a neck sprain that
[patient] thinking are are you saying i'm thinking
[doctor] no not by any means i am saying
[patient] pain i have a lot of pain
[doctor] yes and your pain can be explained by multiple things but thankfully it's not a broken neck is that okay
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so what we are gon na do when we are gon na like try and treat this as conservatively as possible
[patient] said it might be broken
[doctor] what
[patient] pamela said it might be broken
[doctor] if pamela said it's broken then you know what this is what we're gon na do we're gon na order something called a ct that's gon na give us even nope you know what let's upgrade to an mri it's gon na give us the most thorough image of everything that's going on the heart and the soft tissues is that gon na is that so that way we can really get a good image of what's happening inside right
[patient] okay because what the lawyer said i needed was an mri
[doctor] not a problem we're we're gon na make your lawyer happy next step we are going to try working like from the outside in so i do need you to work on getting like you're you're saying you've seen some bruising and some swelling yourself so i want you to put ice on that whenever you're experiencing that in the moment when you wake up i want you to do your best to just like i'm gon na give you some exercises on the sheet and i want you to roll through these exercises every morning right to just get some like movement and like free frenosive movement back into your neck i also wan na put you on a couple medications now i know that you said you were on fentanyl before that's a bit extreme and i i want i i i wan na like monitor this a little more conservatively so what we're gon na start with is something called robaxin
[patient] hurts a lot if i do n't get more fentanyl
[doctor] you know we can refer you to pain medicine if it really is getting that complicated but for this current period we're gon na put you on some robaxin it's gon na be fifteen hundred milligrams and you're gon na take that six to eight hours every six to eight hours and that really should help kinda relax the muscles in the area take off some of that tension and really help with that pain if you're noticing that the robaxin still is n't helping maybe then we can start we can like start using like a heat pad or maybe some icyhot the biofreeze is a really good one to kinda help with that and then we will refer you to physical therapy i think with the mri we can start evaluating maybe some additional steps so rather than you having to like take that fentanyl because i do n't want you to be in danger right like people i do n't want you to get rubbed so what we could explore are local injections right and we can refer you to pain medication and see about like locally injecting the area and that should be able to help you out hopefully with this
[patient] i ca n't go to work like this
[doctor] okay so if it's if it's that bad let's wait for the mri result we're gon na give you off for work because you know you ca n't move and we'll see what the mri says about what whether or not we can get you like true local injections in the moment is that alright for now
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay okay any other questions
[patient] not right now

[doctor] okay . and , um , how many days has this been going on for ?
[patient] the last four days .
[doctor] okay . and is ... is the pain coming and going ?
[patient] um , at first it was coming and going , and then for about the last 48 hours , it's been a constant , and it's ... it's been pretty bad .

[patient] tylenol , but it really does n't seem to help .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] for your next problem your congestive heart failure , um , i do think you're retaining a little bit of fluid . so , i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some lasix 40 milligrams once a day . i want you to continue you on your toprol 50 milligrams daily . and as well your , as well , as your lisinopril 10 milligrams a day . i really want you to watch your salt intake , okay ? get a scale , weigh yourself every day . and call me if your weight starts to go up , okay ?

[doctor] okay . all right . well , let's start with your diabetes . so , your diet's been good ?
[patient] um , for the most part , but we have been traveling all over to different sports tournaments for the kids , so it was , uh , a weekend of , uh , eating on the go , crumby junk food , pizza , and did n't really stick to the diet , so that was a bit of an adjustment .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , but , ha- ha- have you ... let's just talk about your review of systems . have you had any dizziness , lightheadedness , fever , chills ?
[patient] running up and down the stairs , it was pretty warm , so i did feel a little bit lightheaded , and i did get a little dizzy , but i thought it was just the heat and the fatigue .
[doctor] okay . any chest pain , shortness of breath , or belly pain ?

[doctor] okay . all right . and , how about any joint pain or muscle aches ?

[doctor] okay . all right . um , and , in terms of your asthma , you just said that you were short of breath running up and down the stairs , so , um , do , how often have you been using your inhaler over the past year ?
[patient] only when it seems to go over about 85 degrees out . that's when i really feel it , so that's when i've been using it . if it's a nice , cool , dry day , i really do n't use the inhaler .

[patient] i was taking it regularly , but i've kind of weened myself off of it . i thought i felt a little bit better , but i think , uh , i , i kinda go through battles with depression every so often .
[doctor] okay . all right . are you interested in resuming the medication , or would you like to try a different one ?
[patient] i , maybe adjusting what i'm currently taking , maybe l- less of a dose so i do n't feel the side effects as much , but i , i'm willing to try something different .
[doctor] okay . all right . okay , well , let's , let's go ahead and we'll do a quick physical exam . so , looking at you , you're in , in no apparent distress . i'm feeling your neck . there's no cervical lymphadenopathy . your thyroid seems not enlarged . and , listening to your lungs , you do have some bilateral expiratory wheezing that's very faint , and your heart is a regular rate and rhythm . your abdomen is soft , and uh , your lower extremities have no edema . so , let's go ahead and look at some of your results . hey , dragon , show me the pfts .
[doctor] okay , so your , your pfts , that , those are your breathing studies , and those look quite good , so i know that you're wheezing right now , but , um , you know , i think that we can add , add , um , a regimen to that to help , to help you with your , um , exacerbations during the , the summer months , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , let's look at your ... hey , dragon ? show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so your a1c , you're right , you know , over the past couple months is , you know , your blood sugar's probably been running a little high , so , you know , i know that you're gon na get back on your diet regimen , but , um , for right now , let's go ahead and we'll increase your metformin , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then , hey , dragon ? show me the chest x-ray . okay , good , and your chest x-ray looks fine , so we know that there's no pneumonia there .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] and , it's just is all just from your asthma . so , you know , my impression of you at this time , you know , from a diabetes standpoint , let's , let's increase the metformin to 1,000 mg twice a day . um , and , we will get a repeat hemoglobin a1c in three months , and i want you to continue to monitor your blood sugars at home .
[doctor] from an asthma standpoint , let's continue you on the albuterol , two puffs , uh , every four to six hours as needed , and we'll add symbicort , two puffs twice a day during the summer , to kind of help prevent those exacerbations . and then , from a depression standpoint , we'll go ahead and start you on a different medication , zoloft , um , 25 mg once a day and see how you tolerate that . does that sound okay ?

[doctor] so let's just look at those . hey , dragon , show me the pulmonary function tests . okay , so it looks like ... , it's interesting . it says that you might be having a little bit of asthma or , uh , copd . and if you are , we'll talk about that .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] let's look at our x-ray . hey , dragon , show me the most recent x-ray . okay , i said it wrong . hey , dragon , show me the most recent chest x-ray . okay , this is interesting . your ... kind of your diaphragm is a little bit flatter , and we'll see that in some , uh , copd , which happens with smokers often . so let's just do a quick physical exam . i know my nurse did the review of systems with you . is there anything else bothering you that we need to talk about today ?
[patient] no other issues .
[doctor] okay . great . let's do the exam . all right , so your physical exam looks pretty normal other than you've got kind of these mild wheezes in all your lung fields . and so i think you do have copd from your pulmonary function tests , your x-ray , and that . so i'm gon na diagnose you with copd . chronic obstructive pulmonary disease . it means you're not able to exhale appropriately .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] so we're gon na put you on a medicine called combivent . okay , you're gon na do two puffs twice a day . it's gon na help open up your lungs . it's an inhaler .

[doctor] just epipen for anaphylaxis when you need it . um , and what surgeries have you had before ?
[patient] yeah , so carotid . yeah-
[doctor] . yeah , no , uh , your , uh , neck surgery .
all right . well let's , uh , examine you here for a second .
so it's your , uh , this elbow right here ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] and is it hurt- ... tender right around that area ?
[patient] yes , it is .
[doctor] okay . can you flex it or can you bend it ?
[patient] it hurts when i do that , yeah .
[doctor] all right . and go ahead and straighten out as much as you can .
[patient] that's about it .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so there's some swelling there . and how about , uh , can you move your fingers okay ? does that hurt ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] how about right over here ?
[patient] uh , no that's fine . yeah .
[doctor] okay . so on exam you've got some tenderness over your lateral epicondyle . uh , you have some swelling there and some redness . uh , you have some pain with flexion , extension of your elbow as well . uh , and you have some pain on the dorsal aspect of your- of your forearm as well . okay ? so let's look at your x-rays . hey dragon , show me the x-rays . all right . your x-ray of your elbow-
it looks like , i mean , the bones are lined up properly . there's no fracture-
[doctor] . it , uh , there's a little bit of swelling there on the lateral elbow but i do n't see any fracture , so that's good . so , looking at the x-ray and looking at your exam , uh , my diagnosis here would be lateral epicondylitis , and this is basically inflammation of this area where this tendon in- inserts . and probably that happened when you were moving those boxes . so we'll try some motrin , uh , about 800 milligrams every six hours . uh , i'll give you a sling for comfort , just so you can use it if- if it's causing a lot of pain .
[patient] hmm .
[doctor] and it should get better , uh , in about , you know , in a couple of days it should be improved . and if it does n't get better , give us a call and we'll see you some time next week . okay ? so we'll give you a sling , we'll give you the motrin , i'll give you about , uh , 30 , uh , uh , 30 , uh , uh , medications for that . uh , do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , no . thank you .
[doctor] hey dragon , order the medications and the procedures . all right , why do n't you come with me and we'll get you signed out ?

[doctor] were you having some dizziness and some lightheadedness ?
[patient] i was very lightheaded . i- i do n't know . very lightheaded .
[doctor] okay . and have you noticed bleeding from anywhere ?
[patient] i have not . i have n't hurt myself in quite a while . maybe a slight nick from a knife while chopping some onions , but nothing more than that .
[doctor] but no blood in your stools or-
[patient] no .
[doctor] . anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and any type of weight loss or decreased appetite or night sweats ? coughs ?
[patient] uh , s- slightly decreased appetite , but i wish i had some weight loss .

[patient] uh , none of that .
[doctor] okay . all right . um , any nausea or vomiting ?
[patient] not really . yeah . maybe a bit of nausea .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- sitting at the back of a car , that makes me nauseous at times .

[patient] mm , it seems okay . yeah .
[doctor] okay . you're walking around without a problem ?
[patient] yup , yup . just not good enough to run yet , but everything else works just fine .

[patient] yup .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin . yeah , so your hemoglobin is 8.2 , which is quite low for somebody of your height and weight , so we'll have to look into that a , a little bit further . i know that they did the endoscopy in the emergency room . hey , dragon , show me the endoscope results .
[doctor] good . so it looks like you had some gastritis , which is just inflammation of your stomach and they also found a slight polyp , which i know that they biopsied and the results are pending at this time . um , so , you may have had some bleeding from the gastritis . it's not usual for people to have bleeding from that .
[doctor] um , okay , well , hey , dragon , show me the anemia panel . okay .
[doctor] anyway , okay . well , vincent , i think , you know , in terms of , my impression of you is that you've had this newfound anemia and for that , i think that we should go ahead and put you on protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day to help with the gastritis . does that sound okay to you ?
[patient] it does . you're the doctor . i do n't know what it is .
[doctor] so that's just , uh , what we call a proton pump inhibitor which , uh , helps decrease the amount of acid secreted within your stomach .
[patient] got it . makes sense .
[doctor] hey , hey , dragon , order protonix , 40 milligrams , once a day .
[doctor] and i'd like you to try to cut down on your caffeine 'cause that can also irritate your stomach . try not to take any ibuprofen and try to cut down on any alcohol intake , okay ?
[patient] yup , yup . the coffee's the hard part .

virtscribe_D2N021_nan,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez , uh , date of birth is january 13th , 1982 .
[doctor] hey , miss christine , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm good , thanks . how are you ?
[doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great .
[patient] yes , i did .
[doctor] anything new since your last visit ?
[patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine , the one that you prescribed , as i'm still taking my old one . um , the price was a little high on the new one .
[doctor] okay , so did ... did you try the coupon that i gave you ?
[patient] i did not try the coupon , uh , there was a charge of $ 75 .
[doctor] okay , well , next time that ... that coupon should help , and it should only be about $ 3 .
[patient] okay , um ... i do n't have it , do you happen to have another one you can give me ?
[doctor] yep , right here .
[patient] wonderful , thank you so much , and ... and then the gel , they are charging me $ 100 for it . so , i do n't know if this is because it's a ... it's wal-mart , or if i should try somewhere else , or ... maybe you know how or where i can get it cheaper .
[doctor] yeah , let's try something else , um ... sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication , rather than the , the combined medication itself .
[patient] that would be great .
[doctor] so , that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide , uh , maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper . so , that we can do . the unithroid , with the discount code , should only be about $ 9 for 90 days .
[patient] okay , that would be great . yeah , they were charging me $ 75 , and i just could n't pay that .
[doctor] maybe we'll try different pharmacy , as well .
[patient] okay . so , do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ?
[doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it , at least , so i would need to see the , the hyperandrogynism or high testosterone . or , a high dhea , to cause acne , or hair growth , or any of that stuff . but , the numbers are n't showing up out of range .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said . your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it . um , i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study .
[patient] you mentioned the weight loss study , and you mentioned that i have some meal plans , um , that you had given me . i still have those , too .
[doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ?
[patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july , because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freer since , um , i'll be on vacation after july 8th .
[doctor] okay , good .
[patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla , because it's supposed to help your metabolism . is that okay to take ?
[doctor] um , i'm not sure . what is c , cla ?
[patient] i'm not sure what it is , either .
[doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so ...
[patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too , and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss .
[doctor] so , that likely will not help too much . you can try either , if you really want to , but then ... it will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much .
[patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you .
[doctor] it wo n't hurt ... okay , i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but , it also wo n't help that much . so , it's up to you .
[patient] okay . and so , my cousin also suggested amino acids , and that i might find them in certain foods , i guess , for my workout .
[doctor] yeah . amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help , uh , you replenish , and just kind of , feel hydrated .
[patient] okay . are they proteins ? um , my cousin said she had lost some weight , and has been working out every day , but she does n't work , so ... i do n't know .
[doctor] yes , amino acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat , with any protein . so , meats , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing .
[patient] okay , thank you . got it .
[doctor] all right . um , are you allergic to any medications ?
[patient] no , not that i know of .
[doctor] okay . is your s- skin pretty sensitive ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] um , yeah , my size , i will start getting rashes , with different products .
[doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical , as an antibiotic for your acne ?
[patient] no , i've never tried anything for it .
[doctor] okay . we might give you some of that .
[patient] okay . and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot .
[doctor] okay . i'm ... let me take a look at that for just a moment . um , any constipation ?
[patient] yes , i also do have that problem .
[doctor] all right . mira- miralax will definitely help with that .
[patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that .
[doctor] great . all right , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'll listen to your lungs and heart .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , deep breath . all right , again .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , sounds good .
[patient] great .
[doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , they look okay right now , certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs .
[patient] okay , i will do that .
[doctor] now , let's go over your lab work . so , when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing's syndrome . on that test , at least . the salivary cortisol , though , unless you did one wrong ... two of them were completely normal and one was abnormal , so , we might need to repeat that in the future .
[patient] okay , that's okay .
[doctor] all right , so , your cholesterol was quite high . the total cholesterol was 222 . the good cholesterol was about 44 . the bad was 153 , and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 , and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 , and it was 44 . so , your screen for diabetes is ... was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency , and , i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet , or not .
[patient] yes , we did . i- i do need to take one today , though .
[doctor] okay . so , i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels ... everything else seemed to be pretty good , and in decent range .
[patient] okay , that sounds great . so , i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes , um , because i have n't come back since then ... but i was also happy , because one of them was back to normal .
[doctor] okay , great . let's see them .
[patient] okay . so , the one that's 30 , that was almost 200 not so long ago .
[doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 .
[patient] okay , and , and back in october was 254 .
[doctor] yeah , this is much better .
[patient] okay , great . and then it dropped in january , and then it dropped a little more in march , since i stopped taking the medicine in december .
[doctor] okay , that's good . so ... i'm proud of you with the course of your labs , so before i forget , i'm going to , uh , just put your labs into the computer today , and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time .
[patient] okay . so , with the thyroid , and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ?
[doctor] um , i do have a lot of people that have thyroid , thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] this is what i'm , um , i'm going to do . i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions , so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices .
[patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs .
[doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan .
[patient] okay , good . so , the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start ? or , how does that work ?
[doctor] so , we are about to start , as we just got approval last week , and we are just waiting on our paperwork so we can get started .
[patient] okay , and what's involved with that ?
[doctor] so , it'll involve you receiving a medication which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety , or satiety hormones . um , the most common side effects are going to be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea and constipation . they are s- uh , six arms , to the study . one is a placebo , the other ones are a , various as ... various dosages of the medication , excuse me . um , you would receive an injection once a week . also , keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , it's a way of getting them , but , the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor , right , might be only one out of five of our hundred patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] does that make sense ?
[patient] yes , it does .
[doctor] so , we do expect pretty big weight loss , because of what we learn in diabetes study . so , it's a year long , uh , process , and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four , five weeks , i believe . and then , after that , it's once a month . you do get a stipend for partici- for participating in the study , and parking is validated , and whatever else that you need for the study .
[patient] okay , do you know how much the stipend is ?
[doctor] um , i will have to double check for you , and , you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria . so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 , if you do n't have any other medical condition . or , a bmi greater than 27 , if you do have another medical condition , like your cholesterol . um , a bmi greater than 27 would quali- uh , qualify you .
[patient] i have a friend who might be interested , and she does have diabetes .
[doctor] if she has d- diabetes , then she wo n't qualify .
[patient] okay , you ca n't if you ... if you have diabetes , got it .
[doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that , um , they can not have , really , is diabetes . so , either a psychiatric disease , or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that ... they can definitely sign up .
[patient] and they can , okay . thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] of course . so , do you want me to try to get you into that study ? or , would you just like to try , me to prescribe something ? it's kind of up to you .
[patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now .
[doctor] all right , sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research , it's just in my office . um , it is a different phone number , though . so then , if you're interested , just call us within a month , because i do n't know how long , uh , the , the wait will be .
[patient] okay , will do .
[doctor] perfect . so , let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . um , when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card , and then you use your insurance ... then , show them this , and ask how much it'll cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know .
[patient] i will . thank you so much for your help on that .
[doctor] you're welcome . then , what i did is , i gave you a topical antibiotic , plus i gave you the benzoyl peroxide . so , the peroxide may bleach your sheets , but , you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night , so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] but , you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] um , so , that's that . and then , let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low-carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods , and low chole- cholesterol foods .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and again , once you finish your dose of vitamin d , for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000iu daily , so that you're able to maintain those levels . sound good ?
[patient] yes , that sounds great .
[doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are going to get better once you lose the weight , though .
[patient] okay , that would be great .
[doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try once called phexxi , which is kind of like a spermicide , basically .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] if you need some , uh , just let me know .
[patient] okay , i will . i'll let you know .
[doctor] okay , perfect . so , stay put for me now . i'm going to go see if they have discount samples , and bring you that prescription . and then , i'm going to order the labs for next time .
[patient] okay , great , thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome .
[doctor] so , under the plan , under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal . two out of three salivary cortisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's , and therefore we're ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we'll try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin , and remove the previous information . on the hyperthyroidism , we'll print out her prescriptions . unithroid should be better priced with the discount card , and we'll repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_D2N022_nan,"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez , date of birth 1/12/71 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 polyregion , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger , because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of , quote , "" fds tendon , "" end quote . he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr , pa at that institution .
[doctor] at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 , which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint , partial-thickness tear of the right fds , and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact , as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact .
[doctor] his x-rays , four views of the right hand today , show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand , no soft tissue shadows of concern , no arthritis . hi , how are you , mr . gutierrez ?
[patient] i'm good , how about you ?
[doctor] well , how can i help you today ?
[patient] so i was a passenger in , uh , a car that was rear-ended , and we were hit multiple times . i felt two bumps , which slung me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger .
[doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ?
[patient] um , i do n't really know . i just felt , like , it felt like i laid on my finger , and so , i felt like it went back , and it's been hurting since about march . and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened . so i , and i ca n't make a fist , but sometimes the pain's unbearable . and , like , even driving hurts .
[doctor] okay , so this was march of this year , so maybe about three months ago ?
[patient] yeah , and it's still swollen . so i was seeing , uh , an orthopedist , and they sent me to an occupational therapist . and i've been doing therapy with them , and then they sent me to go back and get an mri . so i went and got the mri . uh , then they told me that the mri came back , and it said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection , because the injection was going to make the tear worse .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and then , after he got the mri , he said that i have , uh , a tear in my finger , and that he did n't wan na do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there , and then the oper- , occupational therapy says it's because of the tear . and then , they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing , and doing things with my hand . so i feel like i'm not getting medical care , really .
[doctor] yeah , i see that .
[patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand , because i am right-handed , and i kinda need that hand .
[doctor] what do you do for a living ?
[patient] uh , i'm an x-ray tech .
[doctor] well , um , so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] uh , do you take any chronic medications of su- , significance ?
[patient] uh , i do take a blood pressure pill , and that's it .
[doctor] okay , and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methylprednisolone ?
[patient] uh , that's correct .
[doctor] all right , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . all right , so , lean over here . all right , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse , no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger , normal creases , slightly diminished over the pip of the index finger compared to the middle finger .
[doctor] his index finger rests in a 10-degree pip-flexed , uh , position . all right , is that uncomfortable to correct that , and is it uncomfortable now here ?
[patient] yeah , uh , when you push on it , yeah .
[doctor] all right , how about here ?
[patient] um , there , it's not .
[doctor] okay , not as bad ?
[patient] yeah , it feels , uh , a little numb .
[doctor] gotcha , all right . bend , bend the tip of this finger . bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . keep bending . all right , straighten it out . all right , and now , bend it for me as best you can .
[patient] my goodness . it feels like it's , it's tearing in there .
[doctor] okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger , and bend it as hard as you can . keep bending . all right , straighten that out , and now , bend it for me as best you can . all right , good . now , bend that finger , and i'm going to pull , put it down like this . and then bend that finger for me . okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? all right . now , make a fist . great , so relax the finger . all right , so just keep it , keep , when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand . is that okay there ?
[patient] ow , .
[doctor] okay , okay . so all the hurt , it seems , is stretching , because you have n't been doing this for so long . so , you know what i mean ? so , um , you're going to have to start really doing that .
[patient] well , i've tried . i even bought myself a splint .
[doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you . it actually immobilizes you .
[patient] okay . i thought it would straighten it out .
[doctor] no , no . so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me , as hard as you can , and keep going , going . all right , so , so you're okay . all right , so i would say the following , that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds , and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds , the flexor digitorum superficialis , which is the least important of the two .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , now , there's two halves of it . so it's a partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important , and the other one is just fine .
[patient] so the good one is good ?
[doctor] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] yeah , so you know , i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon blocking excursion of these other tendons , that they ca n't get through to the pulley .
[patient] okay , all right .
[doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection , and i would avoid the dexamethasone , because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone , which is a celestone .
[patient] i've gotten another , uh , methylprednisolone , and that itched me like crazy .
[doctor] did it ? yeah , this one is water-soluble , and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit , and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger .
[patient] all right , we'll give it a try .
[doctor] good . so , you do the shot , and it's going to take about three to five days before it starts feeling better . and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better .
[patient] perfect .
[doctor] all right , so take advantage of that . you've got ta start moving the finger . you're not going to tear anything or break a bone , uh , because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you've got a stiff , sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part , and then you have to do all the stiff part .
[patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up .
[doctor] hmm . okay , so it was injured , and you had scar tissue . and then , you had post-traumatic inflammation . and so , this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like , , my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable , to where you can make some gains . and we actually might need to repeat this as well .
[patient] will i be able to drive ? i drove myself here today , so ...
[doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a post-traumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger , and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so , mr . gutierrez , do you have , um , therapy scheduled or set up ?
[patient] uh , not at the moment .
[doctor] all right , well , i mean , you know that you need to move that finger , and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so i want you to move that finger , finger , but i think it would be , uh , beneficial for you to have an accountability , um , so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody .
[patient] um , okay . that's kinda why i'm here , for you to tell me what needs to be done , you know ?
[doctor] yeah , so i'll write you out , um , an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient once a week for six weeks , um , and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions .
[patient] all right , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , well , i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure , and we'll , and i'll be back shortly .
[patient] thanks , doc .

[doctor] hey , how are you today ?
[patient] all right , how have you been ?
[doctor] i'm good .
[patient] good , good .
[doctor] have you lost some weight or are you at least putting on some muscle ? you look trim .
[patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been .
[doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt . makes you look thin .
[patient] yeah , i guess that's it .
[doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ?
[patient] good , the testosterone's going well .
[doctor] that's great .
[patient] uh , it helped me out . i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects . not so much physically because like i said i've- i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my bloodwork .
[doctor] okay , well that's good .
[patient] so the finasteride i'm only taking half a pill , it's the 5 milligram one .
[doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that .
[patient] and cialis , on the days i work out i take 5 milligrams otherwise i take two and a half milligram pills , but , uh , i have been out of it .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but overall i'm doing well , i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together .
[doctor] good . it's always great to hear . well let's take a look . uhm , i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] please use my general exam template , all right . just take a few breaths .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] in and out .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , everything sounds good , no concerns there .
[patient] great . so i wanted to show you something .
[doctor] sure .
[patient] look at this .
[doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol ?
[patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides . uh , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 milligrams per deciliter , and i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th .
[doctor] right .
[patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers .
[doctor] wow , that's remarkable .
[patient] is it the test ? it's the only change .
[doctor] i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this . i mean there's a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement , meaning those who get good levels of their test see their diabetic control improve .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless , we will take it .
[patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping .
[doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference .
[patient] 145 milligrams per deciliter from 265 milligrams per deciliter is awesome . i also read that it- it's cardioprotective .
[doctor] absolutely .
[patient] my red blood cell count has increased .
[doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though .
[patient] stable .
[doctor] your psa today is also , uh , is good also . it's , uh , .6 i think .
[patient] yeah . , is it ?
[doctor] yeah , it was .5 last year and anything under 4 is good .
[patient] nice , that's good news .
[doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so .
[patient] so in terms of , uh , estrogen control i've been hearing that indole-3-carbinol , or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ?
[doctor] yeah , i've heard of it but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean , your levels are fine and we checked your estra- estradiol and it was not elevated , so .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do , uh , do any more tests ... any more than test once a year , excuse me .
[patient] okay , what about increasing my testosterone to 175 milligrams ? i'm at 140 now .
[doctor] well , your levels are high .
[patient] are they right now ?
[doctor] well , i mean they were last time .
[patient] yeah but i just- just injected though , or i had right before that was taken .
[doctor] i know . i know you had then , uh , when did you inject this time ?
[patient] i figure i'm on my eighth day today .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday .
[doctor] all right .
[patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and ts on it . that helps me .
[doctor] that's a great idea . so look , the biggest issue i've seen , even if your levels today are around 700 , is that your peaks are getting greater than 1,500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness . and your risk will only astronomically go up the higher the dose that we go on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you're feeling well .
[patient] yeah , i'm feeling good .
[doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you're feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean , i get it and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like , back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses . and then they would have a heart attack at 50 .
[patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot .
[doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone , but still .
[patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time .
[doctor] true . but right now i would not change your dose .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] make sense ?
[patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion .
[doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ?
[patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i would prefer the paper prescription .
[doctor] for all of them ?
[patient] sure .
[doctor] all right , will do . i'm gon na get your prescriptions .
[patient] okay , thank you .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_D2N025_nan,"[doctor] next patient is nicole miller . date of birth is 09/18/1949 . patient was called for a follow-up with me for chronic congestive heart failure with diastolic dysfunction . bmp's been , uh , 3,000 in march , and is about six- was up to 6,000 in april . she was increasingly dyspneic . we changed her furosemide and torsemide 20 milligrams by mouth daily . uh to note , the patient is not currently on potassium supplement . her lisinopril had- has also been increased up to 10 milligrams daily in march . also did when i saw her last april . she reported being interested in having her right knee replaced this summer at east metro . it was recommended that we work to control her cardiovascular status before surgery .
[doctor] hey , miss miller , how are you today ?
[patient] i'm doing okay , thank you .
[doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep- we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed .
[patient] yeah , that would not be good .
[doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery .
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay , good . well it looks like you have lost about 3 , 3 and a half pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still , this is positive .
[patient] yeah , i noticed that too . i think the oxyglutinine is helping as well . my urgency to use the bathroom is much better .
[doctor] well that's great .
[patient] yeah , i , i'm pleased about it too .
[doctor] you ever get leg or finger cramps or anything like that ?
[patient] yeah , i had leg cramps the other day , but i thought it might , was maybe just because i was cold as i had my ceiling fan on and fell asleep . i had cramps when i woke up in both legs right here . um i drank pickle juice and it went right away .
[doctor] well do n't , do n't get crazy with the pickle juice because all of the salt in it .
[patient] haha , i know , i only drink about 4 ounces or so .
[doctor] okay good .
[patient] um it went away so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg .
[doctor] sure just , just keep it in moderation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement ? and are you using the bathroom okay ?
[patient] uh yes , everything is good .
[doctor] good . how is your heart burn doing ? any problems with that ?
[patient] no , it did get bad for a while so i tried to take some prilosec and then stopped that other one .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] um i did that for like , gosh , i think it was two weeks back in january and have n't had any problems since .
[doctor] great .
[patient] um and after i stopped taking that um i went back to the stomach one , so i'm doing good now .
[doctor] okay and you're still due for a colonoscopy , correct ?
[patient] uh yeah , that's right .
[doctor] all right , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past but that is still doing great .
[patient] good , that's a relief to hear .
[doctor] your potassium is 3.9 so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was .7 not .8 so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your bun may be a tiny bit elevated at 23 which is the number we look for for dehydration sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . um so when i look at your numbers as a whole i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number- i sent to look at your heart failure number . there is a test called a bmp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3,000 and then went up to 6,000 in april before i made the change . i'm still waiting for those results .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though .
[patient] what about , um what's it called , a1c ? does that show up ?
[doctor] um i do n't think i ordered it but i could . your last a1c was 5.5 in march .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kind of depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check so i might have to repeat that test for pre-op , but i do n't think we need to do it today .
[patient] all righty that sounds good .
[doctor] i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you uh urinate out magnesium with the water pills but it was normal at 1.7 and your blood pressure is also looking good .
[patient] okay great . that all sounds awesome .
[doctor] all right let's take a quick listen .
[doctor] use my general physical exam template .
[doctor] and take a couple of deep breaths for me .
[doctor] your lungs sound pretty good to me so keep doing what you're doing . um uh , like i said , i think you're doing good overall but let's just talk about a few things .
[patient] all righty .
[doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium and get their levels up to around the 2-ish range . yours is a little bit less than 2 and we want that 2-ish range because it can help stabilize the heart muscle . so i might recommend putting you on magnesium supplement . it's supposed to be twice a day so that's kind of annoying , but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too , so i think you'll do fine .
[patient] yeah , that'll be okay .
[doctor] great . now before surgery we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand .
[patient] yes , okay , i have everything written down on my phone , and i have a letter taped to the side of my bed to remind me .
[doctor] perfect ! we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a pre-op check within two weeks of your surgery during the first or second week of june .
[patient] okay , i'll put that down .
[doctor] you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekgs . um we do n't need to any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently , and we do n't need any more blood work because we did that today .
[patient] yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular . but i'm happy to do one today , no problem .
[doctor] lastly , once we get your knee surgery , um we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ?
[patient] yeah , i have both .
[doctor] okay so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like .
[patient] okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out . might we be able to get the procedure done sooner ? maybe in the next 30 days ? is that okay ?
[doctor] um i can put it in right now for , uh , for county for the next 30 days , and they might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take , it should not make you ineligible for the surgery . in other words completing a colonoscopy would not delay your surgery .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so let me see . i've been doing one of two things at every one , and everyone is great so it depends more on timing availability of their or for the colonoscopy . we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical , and they do it at springfield .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] i think either direction they're good technicians of the colon .
[patient] okay , yeah whatever you can get me in , that works great .
[doctor] so i'll call around . now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years then you'll be good to go .
[patient] great , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . have a great day . let us know if you need anything else , okay ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right , assessment and plan .
[doctor] chronic chf . mixed presentation . had a exacerbation of cf , chf earlier in the spring . we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about 3 , 3 and a half pounds down in weight . breathing is non-labored . going to repeat ekg today but otherwise continue with her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate .
[doctor] uh number 2 , pre-op examination . she is , she's having a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed which we'll try to have done at uh bartley regional , rightley regional hospital in the next month , uh , prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer .
[doctor] uh the next one is diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_D2N026_nan,"[doctor] dictating on donald clark . date of birth , 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ?
[patient] good morning .
[doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller .
[patient] it's nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] so , i hear you are having pain this arm . is that correct ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and it seems like it's worse at night ?
[patient] well , right now the hand is .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] and the thing started about two weeks ago . i woke up about two o'clock in the morning and it was just hurting something awful .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up .
[doctor] okay , that's good .
[patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down , thinking it would , like , help the circulation , but it did n't .
[doctor] okay , i see .
[patient] and so , after a while , when it eased off , maybe about four , five am , i laid back down and it did n't start up again .
[doctor] mm-hmm , okay .
[patient] um . i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened , like , over and over . so , i finally went to see the doctor , and i do n't really recall her name .
[doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about , though .
[patient] um , she's the one who sent me to you , so , i , i would , i would think so . but when i went to her after the third time it happened and she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve .
[doctor] probably . uh , do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ?
[patient] um , some days . if it bothers me at night , then the day following , it usually will bother me some .
[doctor] okay . and do you just notice it in the hand , or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ?
[patient] well , it starts there and goes all the way down the arm .
[doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . like , in terms of gripping things ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , this finger , i hurt it some time ago as well .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah . it does n't work properly . or , it works very rarely .
[doctor] gotcha . and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids , or ?
[patient] uh , well , she gave me some numbing medicine . it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin . uh , you should have my full list in your notes , though . since then it has n't really bothered me at night . also , just so you know , i am a va and i'm one percent disabled from this leg , um , issues from my knees down to my feet .
[doctor] okay . is it neuropathy ?
[patient] uh , yep .
[doctor] gotcha . that is good to know . all right , well , let's go ahead and take a look .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . so , to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me . uh , just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good . and now , go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay . and now , come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way . great . and now , as far as you can towards that wall . uh , does that seem to bother you at all ?
[patient] no . well , actually , i do feel a little strain .
[doctor] okay . so , you feel it in the neck a little bit ?
[patient] yeah , just a little strain .
[doctor] okay . uh , now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands . great . now , hold your arms like this .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm going to try to strain your arms and try to keep them as stiff as you can . do n't let me strain it . okay , good . good . now , when i , i'm just touching your hands like this . does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ?
[patient] uh , yes .
[doctor] okay . all right . so , i do agree with betty . uh , more than likely , this seems like it would be coming from your neck . that's the most common reason that causes what , what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck , and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there , and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now , what i do n't have is an mri , which would show me , uh , kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off .
[patient] i see .
[doctor] so , gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain , and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural . and what that is is it , it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine , excuse me , that works behind the nerve roops that , nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms , and i do need to get an mri of your neck . um , i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so , what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . uh , what do you think of that ?
[patient] i think that sounds good to me .
[doctor] okay , good . and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list .
[patient] uh , no , i do n't .
[doctor] okay , good . and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin . um , are you taking 300 or 100 ?
[patient] um , not sure . my lady friend helps me handle this stuff .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i am taking eliquis , though .
[doctor] okay . um , so whatever you are doing you can just keep doing it , and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study , um , just so i know right where to put the medicine . and i will follow up with you after s- um , that's in . we can do the shot , just to make sure your arm is feeling better . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights , though , my neck has not been bothering me .
[doctor] okay . s- um , so , presumably what's happening , then , is when you're sleeping your neck is kind of gets off-tilt , uh , kilter , and it compresses the nerve roots there . now , if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very la- least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on , because probably this is something that will likely flare up again .
[patient] yeah , it , it has been for the last week , so , i understand .
[doctor] okay . all right . well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural , or do you think you're doing fine and you want to wait ?
[patient] well , my hand is still bothering me .
[doctor] okay . so , you're saying your neck is not bothering you but the hand is . okay . so then , let's just stick with the plan . mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots may be compressed , that's giving your hand the issue . and then , we're going to set you up with the epidural .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so , keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck , and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand , and then we'll follow up afterwards .
[patient] all right . is the mri today ?
[doctor] um , you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute , and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can .

The patient’s chief complaint is left arm pain.

The patient reports that his left hand is currently hurting.

The patient reports that his symptoms started about two weeks ago.

The patient reports waking at about two o'clock in the morning with severe arm pain.

The patient reports that applying ice to the arm eased the pain.

The patient reports sitting on the side of the bed and holding his arm down in an attempt to help circulation, which did not help.

The patient reports that after the pain eased around four to five in the morning, it did not start again that night.

The patient reports that this nighttime pain episode recurred over several nights.

The patient reports that he went to see another doctor after the third nighttime episode.

The prior doctor told the patient that the pain was most likely coming from a pinched nerve.

The patient reports that on days after the arm bothers him at night, it usually bothers him during the day as well.

The patient reports that the pain starts in the hand and goes all the way down the arm.

The patient reports weakness in his hand.

The patient reports difficulty gripping things with his hand.

The patient reports that he previously injured one of his fingers.

The patient reports that the injured finger does not work properly and works only rarely.

The prior doctor gave the patient some numbing medicine that helped a little.

The prior doctor prescribed the patient a neck pill.

The prior doctor prescribed the patient gabapentin.

The patient reports that since starting these medications, his arm has not really bothered him at night.

The patient reports that he is a VA patient.

The patient reports that he is one percent disabled due to issues from his knees down to his feet.

The patient confirms that his lower extremity issues are neuropathy.

The patient reports feeling a little strain in his neck with head rotation.

The patient reports that sensation in both hands feels about the same.

The doctor reviewed a cervical spine x-ray for this patient.

The cervical spine x-ray shows a lot of arthritis in the patient’s neck.

The cervical spine x-ray suggests potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve in the neck.

The doctor states that gabapentin can help with nerve pain.

The doctor plans to obtain a cervical MRI to see where the nerve roots are being pinched.

The doctor plans to set the patient up for an epidural injection targeting the suspected pinched nerve roots.

The doctor explains that the epidural is a focused anti-inflammatory medicine placed behind the nerve roots.

The patient agrees to the plan for MRI and epidural.

The patient initially denies taking any blood thinners.

The patient later reports that he is taking Eliquis.

The doctor instructs the patient to continue taking gabapentin.

The patient is unsure whether he is taking 300 mg or 100 mg of gabapentin.

The patient reports that his lady friend helps him manage his medications.

The patient reports that for the last couple of nights his neck has not been bothering him.

The patient reports that his hand is still bothering him.

The doctor plans to order imaging of the patient’s neck.

The doctor plans to follow up with the patient after the epidural to assess his arm symptoms.

On physical exam, the patient presents in a wheelchair.

On physical exam, the patient is in no apparent distress.

On neurologic exam, the patient has 1+ bilateral biceps reflexes.

On neurologic exam, the patient has 1+ bilateral triceps reflexes.

On neurologic exam, the patient has 1+ bilateral brachioradialis reflexes.

On neurologic exam, lower extremity reflexes are negative.

The patient’s gait was not assessed during this visit.

The patient is non-tender over his cervical spine on musculoskeletal exam.

The patient has mildly restricted cervical extension.

The patient has mildly restricted right and left lateral cervical rotation.

Lateral neck rotation produces mild lateral neck pain without radicular pain.

Spurling’s maneuver is benign in this patient.

A cervical x-ray from this visit reveals significant disc degeneration at C5-6.

The cervical x-ray reveals lesser disc degeneration at C4-5 and C3-4.

The cervical x-ray shows significant lower lumbar facet arthropathy.

C6-7 and C7-T1 are difficult to visualize on the current cervical x-rays.

The doctor’s impression is left upper extremity neuropathy suspicious for cervical radiculopathy.

The doctor notes a possible contribution of peripheral neuropathy to the patient’s symptoms.

The doctor’s impression includes neck pain in the setting of arthritis and disc degeneration.

The doctor suspects this is a flare of cervical radiculopathy.

The doctor plans a cervical MRI.

The doctor tentatively plans a left C7-T1 epidural after the MRI, with exact location pending MRI results.

The patient will continue his home exercise program.

The patient will continue gabapentin twice a day.

The doctor plans to follow up with the patient after the epidural to determine his level of relief.

The doctor documents that the patient denies any blood thinners."

[patient] uh , 20 to 30 miles .
[doctor] 20 to 30 miles on a road bike ?
[patient] yeah , road bike . i think it's a time thing . if i had more time , i would try to do my 40 miles , but i have n't done that . obviously , we're too early in the season so my typical ride is , like , 20 , 30 . in years back , i could do 40 on a good day . i can still do 20 but , you know , i'm tired and have to take a break when i get home .
[doctor] yeah , i understand .
[patient] and tyler's my buddy . he's always nice and waits for me , but i used to be able to beat him . but now , he waits for me all the time . he's older than me and it- it kills me .
[doctor] yeah , i can imagine that would upset me too .
[patient] well , the last time , you know , you found a heart thing , then . just making sure that the valve is holding out , you know ?
[doctor] right . so , when was your last stress test ?
[patient] it was september 9th , 2019 , because i'm eight years out from surgery , and back then , they said , you know , it's going to last eight years . and i'm at that year , so i just want to make sure . i asked dr. lewis for an echocardiogram to see how i'm doing .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] but it's not ... like , nothing has changed drastically since i saw you .
[doctor] okay , good . do you still go down to hopkins at all ?
[patient] no , not at all . i just get follow-ups intermittently , here . going there is just ... it's too much stress .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] one more thing , i want to make sure i do n't forget . my wife and friends tell me that when i walk , i purse my lips when i'm breathing . other doctors have said , "" did you notice your pursed lips breathing ? "" i do n't know if that's a bad habit or what .
[doctor] okay . is there any wheezing associated with that ?
[patient] no , no wheezing .
[doctor] and you're able to bike 30 miles and mostly keep up with your friend , tyler , correct ?
[patient] yeah . the only other thing i want to mention is it's not like i do routine testicular exams , but i know i have this little nodule on my right testicle .
[doctor] on the testicle or the epididymis ?
[patient] epididymis . uh , i really do n't know . i'm not super concerned . i read a little online . just wanted to ask you .
[doctor] and did you have a vasectomy ?
[patient] no . let me pull my notes out and make sure i mentioned everything i wanted to tell you . those were the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything . i'm a pretty happy guy overall , you know ? i just know you would ask those questions .

[patient] um , it varies . usually , i get six to seven hours of sleep . i get out of bed some days to be at work by 7:00 , lecture , and i try to work out in the morning . i- i do n't ... i'm not ... i'm not always successful , and now what i do is i- i do make reservations twice a week for a 5:45 swim in the morning .
[doctor] okay , so you're getting six to seven hours of sleep , and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ?
[patient] i believe i snore a little bit , but she's never said anything about me not breathing .
[doctor] okay . so , you're currently taking vitamin d3 , around 5000 units on sundays , and two thous ... or 50,000 units on sundays , excuse me , and 2000s on the other six days , and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures , correct ?

[patient] all right .
[doctor] also your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156 . now this could be related to your liver but most likely related to your bone health . we're going to check a few labs today .
[patient] you're going to have them done today ?
[doctor] yes , sir , and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off then we'll give you a call .

[doctor] now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology , and we will place that referral today , also .
[patient] sounds like i'm going to be busy getting this all checked out .

[doctor] assessment history of the aortic aneurysm repair : the patient underwent and aortic valve replacement and ascending aortic aneurysm repair on 1/20/2013 . he is doing well overall and currently asymptomatic . he is currently not seen by cardiology routinely . suggest the following up and suggested vincent sanchez as his physician . we will perform an echocardiogram , eh , slash , stress test .
[doctor] elevated alkaline phosphatase level . most recent cmd showed elevation at 156 . this could be related to his liver but most likely re- related to his bone health . i've ordered an alkaline phosphatase and again a gt .

[patient] okay .
[doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my steth- stethoscope . and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants .
[patient] what does that mean ? is everything okay ?

[patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side , near my belly button .
[doctor] okay . i do feel stool in your lower colon , which would coincide with constipation , but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ?
[patient] yes , i have a physical about four months ago and they ... i had blood drawn then .
[doctor] okay . and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ?
[patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes , but we would recheck them in about six months .
[doctor] and you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ?
[patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated .
[doctor] and do you take any medications , either prescription or over-the-counter ?
[patient] i take crestor and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasion- occasional pain .
[doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ?
[patient] hardly ever . maybe once a month .
[doctor] and do you consume alcohol ?
[patient] uh , yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays .
[doctor] okay . and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice .
[patient] what would cause that ?
[doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] lungs are clear , bilateral heart sounds are normal , no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted .
[patient] that's good .
[doctor] yes . the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly .
[patient] what's that ?
[doctor] increase stool burden means that there's a lot of stool sitting in your colon .
[patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ?
[doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged .
[patient] but you said mine was slightly enlarged ?
[doctor] correct .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged .
[patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ?
[doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat . and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that .
[patient] so what about my liver ? why is it enlarged ?
[doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to liver , alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease .
[patient] so what do i need to do ?
[doctor] well , i think since it's been about four months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs .
[patient] okay . and then what ?
[doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too .
[patient] which medications ?
[doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ?
[patient] about 18 months .
[doctor] okay . well , crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives .
[patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ?
[doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol .
[patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon .
[doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that .
[patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ?
[doctor] hopefully , within the next two weeks . you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up .
[patient] okay . and then what happens ?
[doctor] when i get the results from the test , i will contact you . and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps .
[patient] and when should i see you again ?
[doctor] uh , let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in four weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver .
[patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ?
[doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation . and be mindful of eating foods that you were sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea .
[patient] okay . and i'll talk to my primary care about my crestor .
[doctor] excellent . and do you have any other questions for me ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] great . so remember when you check out the front desk , schedule follow-up appointment with me for four weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn .
[patient] okay . sounds good .
[doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound .
[patient] all right . thanks , dr. edwards .

virtscribe_D2N029_nan,"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr472348 . she's a 57 year old female who is here for a surgical consult . her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 millimeter lesion which was located on right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma .
[doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you .
[patient] likewise , wish it were under better circumstances .
[doctor] yeah , i hear your dermatologist sent you to me 'cause she found a melanoma ?
[patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said .
[doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ?
[patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month .
[doctor] i see . and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10th to get it checked out , right ?
[patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family .
[doctor] well i'm really glad you took it seriously and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer , and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ?
[patient] my mom and her sister , i think they both had melanoma .
[doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family , like breast or ovarian ?
[patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer .
[doctor] okay , and was that your mom or dad's father ?
[patient] mother's .
[doctor] okay . and , um , have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ?
[patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist . um , but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year at my physical and has n't said , um , he's concerned about any of 'em before .
[doctor] good- good . uh , let's go over your medical history from your chart . i have that you're not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you're allergic to augmentin , is that right ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay , and for social history can you tell me what you do for work ?
[patient] i own an auto repair shop .
[doctor] okay and have you ever been a smoker ?
[patient] yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying .
[doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . uh , what about your surgical history , have you had any surgeries ?
[patient] i had gall bladder and appendix .
[doctor] okay , great , we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been , any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ?
[patient] no , i've been feelin' great .
[doctor] good . well let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] okay , i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon what i'm seeing here , so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ?
[patient] okay , that's fine .
[doctor] all right , so on the right inferior back there's a one centimeter shave biopsy site , including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation . there's no intrinsic or satellite lesions , no other suspicious moles , no axillary , cervical , or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin , but it's nontender , otherwise normal exam .
[doctor] okay , you can sit up . um , so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other s- , um , skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . uh , i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing , um , and , you know , make sure it's nothing that we need to worry about . uh , the reason we're being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further .
[patient] okay , i should n't worry too much then ?
[doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal , the treatment for you melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 millimeters or less , um , and that's what we recommend , and yours was exactly 0.7 millimeters . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery . but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision , meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision .
[patient] okay , that is fine with me , i ca n't see back there anyways .
[doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it , as it heals . um , but since we're , we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you want to check in with me or have any problems . however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly so she can monitor you . uh , your dermatologist will check that this one does n't come back , but she'll also check for other lesions that look suspicious . uh , unfortunately , since you've had one melanoma , you're at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else .
[patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back .
[doctor] good , and i'm sure she's already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight .
[patient] yeah , she definitely went over that , um , several times with me .
[doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . um , we'll get you set up for the ultrasound , the procedure . do you have any questions for me ?
[patient] um , no i ca n't think of any at this time .
[doctor] okay , my nurse will be in to get you scheduled , so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .
[patient] thank you , nice to meet you as well .
[doctor] please add the following pathology r- , to results . a pathology , shave of right inferior back , malignant melanoma , invasive , superficial spreading . histology , superficial spreading . clark level 4 , breslow thickness 0.7 millimeters , radial growth phase present , vertical growth phase not identified . mitotic features , less than one millimeter squared . ulceration not identified , progression not identified , lymphatic invasion not identified , perineural invasion not identified , microscopic satellitosis not identified . infiltrating , uh , lymphocytes , breast . um , melanocytic nevus not identified . predominant cytology epithelioid , peripheral margin positive , deep margin , uh , negative , stage 1 . also note that i reviewed the dermatologist's photo of the lesion which showed an asymmetric black and brown nevus with central a melanotic component and irregular border .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , the patient presents today with newly diagnosed melanoma . biopsy revealed an intermediate thickness melanoma . on examination today , there is right inguinal lymph node with slightly atypical consistency . i recommended an ultrasound to rule out metastatic disease . if the ultrasound is normal , the patient is a candidate for wide local excision with a one to two centimeter margin .

[doctor] hi donna ! how are you ?
[patient] i'm good . how about you ?
[doctor] i'm doing well , thank you . and so , i saw that dr. brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ?
[patient] no , that's new .
[doctor] okay . how is it working for you ?
[patient] my anxiety is going good now , thankfully . i'm serious , it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like , "" i can not do this . "" i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , and she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety . so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what .
[doctor] mm . okay .
[patient] and it would , um , start usually during the day , at work .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] i mean , i'm fine now .
[doctor] well , that's good , that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you are dealing with is hormonal , and that's why i was asking . 'cause you were on the progesterone , and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too .
[patient] i did .
[doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] so i know we started it for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also .
[patient] yeah . and before , in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof . which then , i knew my period was coming . then it turned into my anxiety spiking just at random times .
[doctor] hmm , okay .
[patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason .
[doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] all right . so not really a link there , all right .
[patient] yeah , i do n't know .
[doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . um , sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too .
[patient] i figured maybe that's what it was .
[doctor] and we did go through the golive in november and december , so that can be pretty stressful also .
[patient] yeah , and at work , that's when i first started to lead the process of delivering the results to patients with covid . in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait nine days before they'd get their results . and then we opened the evaluation centers and the covid clinic . so i think it just took a toll on me .
[doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that .
[patient] yeah , and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines . i mean , i was supporting people , sure , but i was n't in the icu . so i felt selfish and guilty . i mean , hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was , having anxiety . and it felt ridiculous .
[doctor] well , honestly , you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so ... but let's see . i need to just put this dax back to work . all right , so no other issues whatsoever ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you lost weight ?
[patient] no , but i stopped taking the camila birth control . my hunger level was at a new high . i mean , i was eating constantly . i felt like , "" what is going on ? ""
[doctor] all right .
[patient] and now i am feeling better .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and your masked face , though , it does look thinner .
[patient] well , the past six months i have lost some weight .
[doctor] okay , good . um , anything else going on ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] all right . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative/negative . um , have you ever had an abnormal pap ?
[patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 , and then i had to be seen every six months for a while . and then i had a normal pap .
[doctor] all right , well , let's just repeat it then .
[patient] yeah , that's fine with me , to be safe .
[doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under , and the potential for getting covid or the vaccine ... i have actually seen some , um , an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while . so that's why i figure let's just check .
[patient] okay . i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it . same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad in how it'll impact her when she gets older .
[doctor] have you had the vaccine ?
[patient] yes , i have . and so has my son . he , um , has had his first already .
[doctor] okay . well , you know , you can only do what you can do .
[patient] yeah , i agree .
[doctor] all right . well , let's complete your exam .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] so let's take a deep breath . and again . all right , you can breathe normally . all right , and take one more deep breath . okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect . and just place your hand above your head . okay , i do feel some little bumps .
[patient] yeah , but they're not as big as they were .
[doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast it does feel a little bit denser . does it hurt at all ?
[patient] it does , where your left hand just was .
[doctor] okay , right here ?
[patient] yeah , down here . but whenever i breastfed , it was always sore there too . i had a clog and something else . the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there , unfortunately .
[doctor] yeah , they are . uh , well now i do n't know , because if it was the progesterone , they would've gone away .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well just let your knees just op- relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ?
[patient] yes , and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] uh , but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help .
[doctor] okay , great . all right , looks good .
[patient] good .
[doctor] you can go ahead and sit up .
[patient] thank you .
[doctor] all right , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles , and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now .
[patient] okay . and what could that mean ?
[doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there's also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cysts and lumps and fibroadenomas , those are all benign things . they're annoying and require some workup , but they're all benign .
[patient] and i'm- i'm just worried because i'm almost 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer . so i mean , i know there's nothing i can do about it , but it's just i feel like , uh , we had it under control and now it is n't .
[doctor] well , i would n't say that . i mean , i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things , and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before , and things actually have n't changed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so those are all good things .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because , um , if it was cancer , we'd actually , we would see some change .
[patient] we would ? okay , thank you for explaining that .
[doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing , but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue , and it's annoying that we have to follow them .
[patient] yeah , i agree there .
[doctor] um , but the only extra that i could po- , uh , potentially do , is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them . and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam , in the office , to check out it- check it out on their own . uh , they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier , if they think it needs , um , if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than , you know , like radiology as to biopsy it .
[patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should .
[doctor] all right . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule .
[patient] okay , i think that sounds great .
[doctor] all right . i do too . all right , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] no , i think i'm all set .
[doctor] all right , good . all right , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else .
[patient] all right , thank you . you have a good day too .

virtscribe_D2N031_nan,"[doctor] sophia brown . date of birth , 3/17/1946 . this is a new patient visit . she's here to establish care for a history of dcis . we'll go over the history with the patient .
[doctor] hello , ms. brown .
[patient] hi . yes , that's me .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm doctor stewart . it's lovely to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] so , you've come to see me today because you had a right breast lumpectomy last year . is that right ?
[patient] yes . on january 20th , 2020 .
[doctor] okay . and how have you been since then ? any problems or concerns ?
[patient] no , i'm feeling good . i do my self breast exams religiously now and have n't felt anything since .
[doctor] perfect . i want to back up and go over your history so i can make sure everything in your chart is correct and i do n't miss anything . so , i'll tell you what we have in your chart from your other providers and you tell me if anything is wrong or missing . sound good ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] great . so , i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram , or was it done because you felt a lump ?
[patient] it was just a normal one you're supposed to get every so often .
[doctor] i see . and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3rd , 2019 , which revealed a mass at the two o'clock position , 11 centimeters from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was point four by two by three centimeters .
[patient] yes , that sounds right . hard to remember now , though .
[doctor] yep , definitely .
[doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5th , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade two , er positive , pr positive , dcis , or ductal carcinoma in situ .
[patient] yes . unfortunately .
[doctor] i know . scary stuff . but you had a lumpectomy on january 20th , 2020 , which removed the eight millimeter tumor and margins were negative . the pathology confirmed dcis . looks like they also removed 5 lymph nodes , which , thankfully , were negative for malignancy . that's great !
[patient] yeah , i was definitely very relieved .
[doctor] and your last mammogram was in january 2021 ? and that was normal .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so , i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now . and you're here today to establish care with me so i can continue to follow you and make sure you're doing well , right ?
[patient] yes . fingers crossed .
[doctor] definitely . we'll keep a close eye on you and take good care of you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] i have a few more questions for you . when was your last colonoscopy ?
[patient] i had one in 2018 and , if i remember correctly , i had one polyp and that was removed and it was n't cancerous .
[doctor] okay , yes , i see that report now . one polyp in the sigmoid colon which had a benign tubular adenoma . okay . and when was your last menstrual period ?
[patient] gosh . it was probably around 30 years ago .
[doctor] okay . do you have children ?
[patient] i do . i have five .
[doctor] ah , big family then . that's nice .
[patient] yes . and they're all having kids of their own now , so it's getting even bigger .
[doctor] i bet . sounds like fun .
[patient] it is .
[doctor] did you have any other pregnancies that were miscarriages or terminations ?
[patient] really , i did not .
[doctor] okay . so for the record , that's g5 p5 . and now that you're post-menopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ?
[patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago but i decided against it .
[doctor] okay . and on your review systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools . but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those .
[patient] okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they've said , excuse me , the back and knee pain are age-related . and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis , but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication .
[doctor] okay . and your primary care doctor is following you for that , right ?
[patient] that's correct .
[doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit . is that all right ?
[patient] yes , and that's all .
[doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all .
[doctor] okay . and how about family history ?
[patient] my mom had non-hodgkin's lymphoma and my dad had prostate cancer and heart disease , but i think that's it .
[doctor] all right . any family history of breast cancer ?
[patient] none .
[doctor] did any of your children have medical issues or siblings with medical problems ?
[patient] i do not have any siblings and , thankfully , my children are all healthy .
[doctor] wonderful . do you have any history of smoking , illicit drug use , heavy alcohol consumption ?
[patient] no drugs . i do drink socially , but never more than that . and i used to smoke , but really , everybody did back then and i probably quit about 30 years ago .
[doctor] excellent . i have that you're allergic to penicillin . any other allergies ?
[patient] nope , just penicillin .
[doctor] okay . i think that covers it . hop up here and let me take a look at you .
[doctor] okay , so let's use the normal new patient exam template . only change to make is the breast exam . there are no palpable masses , however , there is skin thickening at the medial inferior aspect of the right breast which may be radiation skin changes .
[doctor] in the result section , note that her ecog performance status today is zero .
[doctor] do you have ... did you have radiation after the lumpectomy ?
[patient] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that .
[doctor] okay . so your exam looks good , no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now , let's go over the plan for you .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] as you know , you've had dcis which we'll list in my note as stage zero , er/pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . your status post-lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had , um , radiation therapy but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy and your mammogram in january , 2021 was also negative for recurrence and malignancy .
[doctor] so , based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you .
[patient] okay . that sounds great . and when do i come back in to see you ?
[doctor] in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april of 2022 before you come back to see me .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ?
[patient] i do n't think so .
[doctor] okay , great . my nurse will be in shortly to discharge you . take care !
[patient] you as well .","S (Subjective):

aci_D2N034_nan,"[doctor] alright you can go ahead
[patient] hey alan i good to see you today so i looked here my appointment notes and i see that you're coming in you had some shoulder pain left shoulder pain for the last three weeks so
[doctor] how you doing is it is it gotten any better
[patient] yeah yeah i've been having a lot of pain of my shoulder for the last three weeks now and it's not getting better okay do you remember what you were doing when the pain first started
[doctor] so i i was thinking that i i ca n't recall like falling on it injuring it getting hit
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i have been doing a lot of work in my basement and i even i put in a new ceiling so i do n't know if it's from all that activity doing that but otherwise that's that's all i can think of
[patient] okay so do you remember hitting it or anything like that
[doctor] no nothing at all
[patient] okay alright did you fall do you remember doing that
[doctor] no
[patient] okay hmmm so like a little mystery so have you had pain in that shoulder before
[doctor] i mean i'm very active so i can get pains in my shoulders but it's nothing that sometime some tylenol can help
[patient] okay and are you able to move the arm or is it kinda just stuck
[doctor] i'm having a lot of pain like i can move it but you know when i try to reach for something lifting anything and even like i do n't even try to put my hands over my head because it causes so much pain
[patient] alright so does that pain radiate anywhere or like where would you say it is in your shoulder
[doctor] it actually it stays pretty much just right at the shoulder it does n't go down anywhere
[patient] okay and the pain is it is it all the time or does it come and go
[doctor] it's pretty much all the time anytime i put any pressure on it like when i'm trying to sleep it hurts even more so it's been affecting my sleep as well
[patient] okay so i know you mentioned tylenol so this time i have n't taken anything for it
[doctor] yeah i i do the tylenol which usually works for me and it does take the edge off but i still have pain okay did you try icing it at all
[patient] i iced it initially but i have n't iced it at all recently
[doctor] alright
[patient] and so with your shoulder have you experienced any numbness in your arm or in your fingers
[doctor] no numbness or tingling
[patient] okay good so i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam and take a look at your your shoulder so i reviewed your your vitals everything looks good with that so touch here in your shoulder so your left shoulder exam you have limited active and passive range of motion so pressure here so that there is tenderness of the greater
[doctor] okay
[patient] tuberosity of the humerus let's see there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro
[doctor] yeah
[patient] acromioclavicular joints
[doctor] yeah yeah
[patient] and looks like you have good hand grip let me see so on the neurovascular exam of your left arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation is is intact to light touch
[doctor] yes thank you yep
[patient] so you did get a we get we had to get a x-ray of your shoulder before you came in and so it's normal so that's really good so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you you do have that left shoulder pain so your symptoms are
[doctor] most likely due to a rotator cuff tendinopathy so this means that you injured tendon you have injured tendons and muscles that make up your shoulder and make up your shoulder muscles so what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na order an mri of your left shoulder
[patient] and so we're gon na begin with that just to make sure nothing else is going on have you done physical therapy before
[doctor] i have n't
[patient] okay so what i'm gon na do i'm going to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so they can help you strengthen those muscles around your shoulder and that should definitely help with the pain during that time you can also continue to take tylenol i do n't think i need to prescribe anything else for the pain you said as it's working pretty good for you so if your symptoms do n't improve we can consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which should provide some relief but i think right now we can just go with the the pt and hopefully that works to alleviate your injury so do you have any questions about the plan
[doctor] so like i said i'm really active do you think that this pain will ever go away
[patient] yeah so many patients are very successful with rehab and so we'll start with that and see how you do most most of the time once we build up those muscles around that shoulder you know things things the pain alleviates itself and and and you will be good to go back to working on your basement and running and jogging and lifting weights all all the active things people do these days

aci_D2N036_nan,"[doctor] hey george how are you today i understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist
[patient] right my right wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness
[doctor] okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or
[patient] it just kinda started on it's own it i notice it mostly at night
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes it will i'll wake up and my hands asleep and i got ta shake it out
[doctor] shake it out and okay
[patient] and then some
[doctor] what kind of work do you do
[patient] i do yard work
[doctor] yard work
[patient] landscaping landscaping
[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this
[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it
[doctor] okay take care and i'll look forward to see you in two weeks
[patient] very good appreciate your time","S (Subjective):

aci_D2N037_nan,"[doctor] hey dylan what's going on so i lift quite a bit of weights i try to stay in shape as much as i can i'm not like normal people i lift heavy weights and my elbow is extremely sore which elbow is it
[patient] actually it's both my elbows but my right elbow is hurting me the most
[doctor] okay and you said you lift a lot of weights
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] did you play any sports when you were younger
[patient] no anything you can think of primarily it was basketball baseball and football
[doctor] okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury
[patient] it's new
[doctor] when did it start
[patient] probably year and a half ago
[doctor] okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams three times a day
[doctor] okay and does anything make it better or worse
[patient] the more i use my hands or my arms the more it hurts
[doctor] okay have you tried icing
[patient] yes
[doctor] does that give you any relief
[patient] no
[doctor] alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows
[patient] inside
[doctor] inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers
[patient] i think so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay great
[patient] good to go
[doctor] sensation is normal to the touch
[patient] yes
[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited
[doctor] yeah and we can hopefully get you scheduled for that in the next couple of weeks it's not not a major procedure and you should heal in the next two weeks so that wo n't be a problem especially considering that you're expecting a newborn soon we want to make sure you're all healed for that
[patient] wow i did n't even say that
[doctor] i read it in your chart

aci_D2N038_nan,"[patient] hey bruce so see here my my notes here is you here he had positive lab work for hep c so how're you doing today
[doctor] i'm doing okay but i'm a little bit anxious about having hep c i've really surprised because i've been feeling fine they had done it as you know a screen as just part of my physical so i'm really surprised that that came back positive
[patient] okay so in the past have any doctors ever told you that you had hep c
[doctor] no never that's why i'm i'm so surprised
[patient] okay so just you know i need to ask do you have a history of iv drug use or you know have known any hep c partners
[doctor] i mean i used to party a lot and even did use iv drugs but i have been clean for over fifteen years now
[patient] okay that that's good i mean i'm i'm happy that you were able to to kick that habit i know a lot of my patients that i see you know they're still dealing with with those dements so i'm i'm i'm happy that you're able to do that so hopefully we can get you better okay
[doctor] thank you
[patient] so what about alcohol use is that something that you used to do a lot
[doctor] i did i did i mean i i still have a beer here and there everyday but not as much as i used to
[patient] okay and have you ever smoked before
[doctor] i do smoke i smoke about one to two cigarettes per day i've cut down a lot but i'm just having a hard time kicking those less too
[patient] yeah yeah and that that's something i've got to work on too because hep c along with smoking you know both of those are n't are n't good so hopefully we can help you out you know if your pcp has n't prescribe something for you already and possibly we can we can do that for you as well
[doctor] okay
[patient] so do you have any other medical conditions
[doctor] no i'm actually other than that i just had my physical and i'm not taking any medications no i'm i'm pretty good otherwise
[patient] okay and what conditions would you say run in your family
[doctor] i have high blood pressure diabetes and depression
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so let me go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you so i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good and on general appearance you appear to be in no distress no jaundice on the skin on your heart exam you have a nice regular rhythm rate
[patient] regular rate and rhythm with a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur is appreciated on your lung exam your lungs are clear without wheezes rales or rhonchi on your abdominal exam bowel sounds are present your abdomen is soft with no hepatosplenomegaly
[doctor] hepatosplenomegaly yes let me i will change that one
[patient] splenomegaly and on your muscle exam there is no gait disturbance or edema so i did we i was able to review your your results of your recent lab work and your hcv antibody test was positive so your your liver panel we did one of those and it showed an elevated ast at thirty nine but your alt albumin and total bilirubin were all within normal limits so that's pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you do have hepatitis c so your initial labs were consistent with that hep c diagnosis and so you know i do n't know if you read much about hep c but hepatitis c is a viral infection that does affect your liver and you've most likely had it for several years now it it it most patients do n't see symptoms until years later so the next step that i would like to do is just confirm the diagnosis with some additional blood work so that includes checking your hep c rna and your hcv genotype and i would also like to determine the severity of your liver disease by checking for fibrosis of the liver and we will do that by ordering an ultrasound elasto elastography with this information we will we we will be able to know how we can proceed as far as treatment right so how does that sound
[doctor] i hmmm so i do have a wife and kids so should i be worried about them
[patient] okay yeah so we can start with the same screening that you had for august first so we'll just let's do that hep c antibody test and i'll actually help you set up those appointments with your your family doctor and then we can just see you back in three weeks and based on the results you know we will take action as needed okay
[doctor] okay that sounds good
[patient] alright

aci_D2N039_nan,"[doctor] hi virginia how are you today what brings you in
[patient] i'm doing alright i started seeing this new pcp last year and you know she has been doing a lot of changes to my medication and making sure everything is up to date and she my noticed that my blood pressure has been quite high so she added to medications but and but i you know i've been taking them i've been really good and i i before i was n't but now i am and we're still having a hard time controlling my blood pressure so she thought it would be a good idea for me to see you especially since she noted some on my last blood work she said something about my kidneys
[doctor] okay yeah so okay let's before i dive into a lot of that tell me a little bit about how you've been feeling
[patient] i would say you know most of the days i feel fine i'm still busy at work i definitely can tell though when my blood pressure is high
[doctor] okay you measure it at home you you you measure your blood pressure at home
[patient] yeah i she wanted me to get a blood pressure cuff so i did start getting checking my blood pressures probably like a few times a week
[doctor] okay
[patient] and so then i noticed that it has been getting higher the other day was even as high as one seventy over ninety
[doctor] wow
[patient] so i did call my pcp and she increased the meds again
[doctor] yeah okay now i i just have a couple questions about that are you using a an electronic blood pressure recorder or do you have somebody help you at home
[patient] yeah she i have a a electronic one an electronic arm one
[doctor] okay okay yeah that's good that's good and have you ever tried do you go to cvs at all
[patient] yeah i i do but i've noticed like since the pandemic i do n't see the blood pressures anymore
[doctor] okay okay yeah i i thought the one down on main street they i thought they just brought that one back so
[patient] did they
[doctor] yeah
[patient] that's good to know
[doctor] you may wan na check that but okay so that's good but i what i'd like you to do with that is i'd like you to keep a record of them for me for my next visit with you so let's talk a little bit about your diet tell me how how is your diet what what are the what kind of foods do you like what do you eat normally
[patient] alright do you want the honest answer
[doctor] well yeah that would be better
[patient] so i really you know with everything going on i really been trying to get better but i mean during football season it's really difficult i really love watching my games so have a lot of pizza wings subs like i said i've been trying to cut down especially on days where there is no games but it probably could be better
[doctor] okay i think we all can say that but i do wan na just hey i do n't know that if you've tried it or not but there is a new restaurant down on fifth street and it is nothing but solids and i you know when i heard this i was like okay yeah it's just another these solids are absolutely amazing so if you ever get a chance yeah if you ever get a chance try try that i mean i think you would enjoy them because they're salads that they make are just out unbelievable so let me go ahead and i just have a few more questions and i'm gon na just ask these in in order and you just tell me and then we will come back and talk about them do you have any headaches
[patient] really just when my blood pressure gets really high i have some mild headaches but otherwise i do n't have it on a regular basis
[doctor] okay what about chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] shortness of breath
[patient] no shortness of breath
[doctor] even with exertion
[patient] even with exertion
[doctor] okay do you have any swelling in your lower extremities at all that you noticed
[patient] not if i'm on my feet for a long time i'll notice a little bit of swelling but otherwise no
[doctor] okay and then a couple other family history questions anybody in the family have kidney disease or significant high blood pressure
[patient] both my parents do have high blood pressure and one of them did have kidney disease
[doctor] okay okay and in the the the form that you filled out when you came in it says that you are on ten milligrams of norvasc daily and carvedilol twenty five milligrams twice a day is those the medicines you're on
[patient] yes i was also on lisinopril before but with the adjustments yeah those are the ones i'm on
[doctor] okay and so here's where i think we are going to go do you take any nonsteroidals like advil or motrin or aleve
[patient] yeah just once in a while for my like any knee pain or back pain that i have but again not like everyday
[doctor] okay and then lastly what kind of alcohol intake do you have you know do you consider how many drinks a week is really what i'm looking for
[patient] i'll have a couple of beers during the week and like one or two on the weekends
[doctor] okay okay so lem me do a quick physical examination so i looked at your vitals when you came in today and your blood pressure it's still high it's one sixty nine over seventy four your heart rate was eighty eight and your oxygenation was ninety eight percent so those are all fairly good except that blood pressure's a little higher than we'd like to see now when i look at your neck i do n't see any jugular vein distention and i'm gon na listen here real quick no i do n't hear any carotid bruits i'm gon na listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and let me listen quickly to your heart i do hear that a two over six systolic ejection murmur and we'll we're gon na have to take a little bit look extra look at that that's when i i can hear an extra sound when i'm listening to your heart and you do have a small amount of one plus pitting edema bilaterally now i did so you do have that your diagnosis is uncontrolled hypertension you know and i think you're aware that that's what your your physician's been treating you for and most of the time this cause is is the cause of this is multifactorial it's not that there is just one thing causing it so we may need to be changing your medicine around and i'm gon na talk to your doctor but first thing before we make any more medication changes i want to order some tests first to rule out if there is any specific cause for this so first order will be a renal artery ultrasound and what i'm looking for there is that there is no areas of areas of narrowing in the the blood vessels of your kidneys that would be the cause of your hypertension in addition to that i'm gon na order a you get another urine collection some morning aldosterone levels reining levels and a twenty four hour urine and these things can really show me if there is any problems with your adrenal glands again this is a lot of big words but you know i'm i i'll write this all out for you i want you to decrease your alcohol i know you like those beers but let's bring it down to maybe one a week or two a week just to get those down lower and then your salt intake you need to be very judicious about decreasing that salt intake i'm gon na give you a referral to a nutritionist to discuss those changes for that you need and and they will help you get that cleared up and then finally stop taking any nonsteroidal medicines such as your advil or motrin the only thing i really want to want you taking is tylenol for any pain right now i am gon na prescribe one medicine and that's cardura four milligrams and i want you to take that once a day and that's good to see if that can help us with your blood pressure and then finally three weeks i'd like you to return i want you to record all of your blood pressures that you take over the next three weeks and bring them into the office but most importantly if you can try to take them at the same time everyday that would be beneficial for me any questions for me
[patient] no i i just it's a lot so i i'm hoping this will work and this will get it under control
[doctor] yeah i i think you know this will be you know this we're gon na spend some time together so i'm glad to have you as a patient but you know we got ta try to get this under control and i'm gon na i'll be talking to your pcp just to let them know that you know what my plans are and we'll stay real in sync on treating this as we move forward does that sound like a plan

[patient] yeah i've done some ibuprofen or aleve sometimes some tylenol and that does help
[doctor] okay
[patient] it takes the edge off
[doctor] okay but you're never really pain free is that what i hear you saying
[patient] not really unless i'm like really just resting which i hate to do but otherwise any type of movement especially from sitting it causes pain
[doctor] okay so are you active other than going up and down the steps to your office
[patient] very i'm a big runner i love to run i run about five to six miles a day but with this knee with with these knee pain that i've been having it's i barely can even do half a mile

[patient] yeah i doctor wood is my primary care provider and i talked to him about it actually over the years and this last visit he said he referred me to you
[doctor] okay okay good so ice and rest makes it feel better running and and activity makes it hurt a little bit more is that correct
[patient] yeah that's right
[doctor] okay do you have any family history of arthritis or any of those type of immune diseases
[patient] i'm trying to think no i do n't think so no
[doctor] okay and do you get is it is this primarily worse in the morning or does it is it just there all the time when it comes on
[patient] it actually is worse towards the end of the day
[doctor] okay
[patient] once i'm on my feet all day it starts to ache towards the afternoon
[doctor] okay so let's go ahead and i want to do a quick examination here your blood pressure and was one twenty over sixty that's phenomenal your heart rate was fifty eight and you can tell that you're a runner with that that level of a heart rate and your respirations were fourteen so all of that looked very good there was no fever when you came in when i'm gon na just quickly listen to your heart and lungs okay those those sound good but let me get let's focus here on your lower extremities i'm i'm gon na look at your your left knee first when i move your left knee do you get any type of pain or is it just feel like normal and it's always your pain's always isolated to the right
[patient] that feels that feels normal
[doctor] okay okay so let me i just want you to back up here in the stretcher a little bit more and i'm just gon na do some movement of your knee any okay so i want you to push your leg out against my hand does that hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and if you pull back does that hurt a little bit
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and i'm gon na move it around so when i look at the knee there is no redness there's no swelling i can appreciate a a small amount of effusion and that means that there's a little bit of fluid under the knee or in that knee's joint space and there is there is several reasons that could be now when i push on your knee does it hurt more on the inside or does it hurt more on the outside here
[patient] the the right knee here hurts on the outside
[doctor] okay okay and you've got a good pedal pulse so you know you can feel that and when i touch your feet you do n't have any numbness or tingling or anything like that
[patient] no uh uh
[doctor] okay well so what i want to tell you is that i think you have a knee sprain from overuse and we see that sometimes in runners now unfortunately you're gon na have to take some a little bit of time off of of active running but i do n't think it will be that long until we can get you up and running again now i reviewed the x-rays that we did when you first came into the office here this morning and the joint spaces of that right knee are are well maintained i do n't see any evidence of any fracture and when compared to the left knee everything looks good so i do n't even see any signs of any arthritis that i would've been suspecting i would like you to stay on two tylenol five hundred milligrams and two ibuprofen two hundred milligram tablets and i want you to take that three times a day and that's gon na help with both the pain and the inflammation i'm also gon na order some physical therapy for your your right knee and that physical therapy will help strengthen the lower extremities and make it give you a little bit of a balance and some they'll be able to recommend good running exercises for you i do wan na follow up with you in two weeks and see if we're getting better so let's no running for two weeks and if we're we're improving then we'll move on and probably start adding some additional activity does that sound like a plan
[patient] yeah that does i i was curious so i will lay off the running for now can i you know lift weights and do like my squats and and those type of exercises at the gym
[doctor] yeah absolutely and and those are good exercises but i'd like you to get that first physical therapy appointment in and they'll be able to talk with you on what the best exercises are for you to do
[patient] okay got it
[doctor] any questions
[patient] hmmm no i do n't think so
[doctor] okay thank you abigail and i'd like i said stop out at the desk and we'll make an appointment for two weeks

[patient] i do n't hear the question but i'm assuming that you when you say batcher so when i start talking about my dog and my three cats and all that those sort of things are not going to be included in the in the note
[doctor] right i want you you can talk about those things yes
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay so with your newly diagnosed ovarian cancer so how are you feeling today how are you doing
[patient] i'm doing pretty good depressed
[doctor] little depressed i can understand it's a lot to take on is n't it
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay okay so lem me ask you some questions so what kind of symptoms were you having that prompted you your doctor to do the tests
[patient] i was having severe pain and bleeding
[doctor] okay now do you have other symptoms such as weight loss constipation vomiting or issues with urination
[patient] no vomiting but constipation and weight loss
[doctor] okay yeah that's understandable so do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[patient] i'm sorry i did n't hear that part
[doctor] do you have any children or have you ever been pregnant
[patient] no to either one of those
[doctor] okay so and do you know at what age you got your period and when you started menopause
[patient] thirteen for my period and twenty eighth for menopause
[doctor] okay do you take any oral hormone replacement therapy
[patient] no
[doctor] okay any history of endometriosis
[patient] any history of what
[doctor] endometriosis
[patient] no
[doctor] okay how about any family history of any gynecological cancers
[patient] i was adopted
[doctor] okay okay so i'm just gon na do a quick exam of your abdomen and then perform a vaginal exam okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright okay so i do feel the mass on the where to go here okay
[patient] i did n't know you're gon na play a doctor today
[doctor] i did okay okay so i do feel the mass on the left side but everything else looks good and on abdominal exam there is slight tenderness to palpation of the left lower quadrant no rebounding or guarding on vaginal exam there are no external lesions on the labia the vaginal vault is within normal limits the cervix is pink without lesions and on bimanual exam i appreciate a left adnexal mass and there is no masses on the right okay so now i reviewed the results of your abdominal ct which show a three centimeter left ovarian mass with an associated local localized lymph node involvement there is no evidence of gross peritoneal or metastatic disease so lem me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for the first problem so i do think this is most likely ovarian cancer looking at your ct scan it looks like stage three a disease based on the lymph node involvement i want to start by sending off some blood tests like a ca-125 and hcg and afp and ldh these are just tests that help me to determine what type of tumor i'm dealing with and then i want you to undergo genetic counseling and testing to see if you have a genetic predisposition for developing ovarian cancer so this stage of ovarian cancer is treated by performing surgery followed by adjunct chemotherapy so this means we'll start chemotherapy after you've recovered from surgery okay so for the surgery i would perform a hysterectomy remove both ovaries and perform a lymph node dissection to remove the involved and involve lymph nodes as well as any other ones i see and i'll also send a sample of any tissue if there anything that looks suspicious at all and we'll be able to tell exactly what stage this is based on the pathology reports i then recommend chemotherapy with cisplatin and taxol and based on how the surgery goes i may want you to receive intraperitoneal intraperitoneal chemo which is done inserting a small tube into your belly for the chemo to go directly into your peritoneum now i know that was a lot sick in do you have any questions or
[patient] am i gon na die
[doctor] well that's a good question so based on what i see at this time i will we believe you have a favorable diagnosis prognosis and you're also still young and healthy which makes your prognosis even better and we do need to see a final pathology report to give you a definitive answer though okay

[doctor] okay alright tenderness to palpation of the midfoot and positive piano key test of the first and second metatarsals alright it's also warm to touch alright so on your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is less than three seconds strong dorsalis pedis pulse and your sensation is intact to light touch your left foot exam is normal capillary refill is appropriate pedal pulses are strong and sensation is intact so i know that before here we before i came in that we got an x-ray so i've reviewed the results of your x-ray of your right foot and it showed subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space alright i know those were a bunch of fancy words so now i'm gon na explain to you what that all means for my impression and plan your first problem is right foot pain consistent with a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones near the top of your foot right so the big part of your toe is the first metatarsal the second part where you can kinda like bend it right that's the that's the metatarsal that we're talking about based on your exam and what i'm seeing on your x-ray i am gon na recommend surgery for your foot the surgery will help place the bones in their proper positions using plates and screws to help prevent further complications there are also many ligaments at the top of your foot so i will be ordering an mri to further assess the fracture and any injury to the ligaments i know this is a lot do you have any questions
[patient] yeah do i have to do the surgery
[doctor] so i'm recommending it as there can be significant complications to your foot if you do n't it can lead to poor bone alignment or poor ligament healing which can lead to you losing the arch of your foot and becoming flat-footed you can also develop arthritis in that foot so yes i i i highly recommend it if you want to be able to walk and move about in a way that you are familiar with
[patient] i just hate that word surgery doc
[doctor] i know
[patient] you know it scares me every time i mean especially with my foot i want to be able to walk again and so i just get really worried i mean how long is the procedure usually too
[doctor] so it's actually
[patient] have to be in the hospital
[doctor] no no no no no it's actually a day surgery and you'll be able to go home the same day and then you will follow up with me here in the clinic in about a week you'll be in a cast and you will use crutches as you will not be able to use that foot for six to eight weeks after that you'll start gradually walking on your foot based on how you do so the procedure itself is not very long you will and so like since you will be able to go home that's great but you wo n't be able to drive especially since you're saying are you left handed or right handed
[patient] i'm right handed
[doctor] yeah so your your right foot is probably your dominant one and the also the one you're supposed to drive with so no you're gon na you're gon na need somebody to take you home but what
[patient] i mean
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] does that mean i'm out for the rest of the season i mean i wan na be able to get back and play again i really am i'm getting a little better so i
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i really wan na keep on playing my tennis with my friends but
[doctor] yeah so unfortunately yes it does mean that you're out for the rest of the season but hopefully we can get you a great get you to a set up well for next season and in the meantime i think i'm gon na recommend after surgery that we get you to physical therapy i think that that's gon na be a really great way to like kinda strengthen the muscles and make sure that you're at peak performance before we put you back out there
[patient] i suppose so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] thank you
[doctor] no problem so i do wan na let you know that there are some risks associated with any kind of surgical procedure i'm gon na bring you some paperwork and that my ma is gon na go over with you such as like risks of bleeding loss of sensation nerve damage all those things will be discussed with you and if you have any questions leading up to and even after your procedure go ahead and ask them and we'll be more than happy to help with that okay

aci_D2N049_nan,"[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on
[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tinnitus on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

aci_D2N050_nan,"[doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them
[patient] yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened
[doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate
[patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin
[doctor] okay
[patient] not the whole way down but almost to the groin and since then i have n't had any more pain and it's just been right about there
[doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go
[patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual
[patient] no not really not really darker
[doctor] okay so have you had kidney stones before and then you said your father had them but
[patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one
[doctor] okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means
[patient] i have a stroke
[doctor] can you repeat that
[patient] i did i have a stroke
[doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone hasses and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good
[patient] that sounds perfect dear too

[doctor] okay alright and any chest pain or shortness of breath or anything like that no no yeah no nothing more than yeah i would n't attribute anything
[patient] okay and do you have a podiatrist for your yearly foot exams
[doctor] no i i i do n't okay alright alright well let's go ahead i wan na just do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings so your vital signs here in the office you do n't have any fever so that's good your blood pressure is great it's like one twenty seven over eighty and your heart rate is nice and slow in the sixties on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or any carotid bruits on your lung exam your lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally on your heart exam you do have a two out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do n't appreciate any palpable dorsalis pedis or posterior tibial pulses there is a two by three centimeter ulcerated lesion on the right lateral foot near the fifth metacarpal metatarsophalangeal joint there is no associated cellulitis does it hurt when i press here
[patient] no
[doctor] there is no pain to palpation of the right foot there is associated granulation tissue and some slight purulent discharge from the wound okay so what does all that mean that just means that you have this ulcer that's you know fairly sizable with i think we need to do some good wound care on it let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you know i you have a nonhealing ulcer of your right foot so we need to do some studies on you to see if you have an adequate blood supply to heal this foot wound and since you since you probably do n't because of your diabetes you're here in a vascular surgeon's office we may have to go ahead and talk about being able to open up some of your arteries to improve the blood supply to your foot so that might mean getting a stent to one of your arteries in your legs to open up the blood supply it might mean mean that we might have to do some bypass surgery to to improve the blood supply to your foot in order to heal that that wound i do think that you'll be able to heal it i do n't think that we need to do anything drastic i want you to continue with your aspirin because that will help
[patient] any questions
[doctor] yeah i mean is this do we have to do any more tests or anything what are you we're gon na do an arterial ultrasound i'm going to go ahead and order an arterial ultrasound of your lower extremities to see what the blood supply is like and then i'm gon na go ahead and order a podiatry consult because i want them to see this wound and improve the wound care that you're doing and then for your next problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and talk to your primary care physician we need to get your diabetes better controlled because that impacts your wound healing as well okay
[patient] sure

[patient] but it still hurts even with ibuprofen
[doctor] alright have you noticed any nausea vomiting fever chills
[patient] i have n't thrown up but i felt a little bit nauseated
[doctor] little nauseated yeah that's we expected so have you do you have a family history of kidney stones i know some people when they have them like their parents have them stuff but
[patient] yeah my my dad had kidney stones i think he has passed a couple of them i'm not quite sure
[doctor] alright and have you had any in the past or is this your first one
[patient] this is my first time i've never had this before
[doctor] okay alright so we'll do we'll do an exam on you just to check you out so i guess you were in pain and stuff over the over the easter easter break there that
[patient] yeah yeah i had some pain over the weekend i saw my pediatrician this morning so they sent me over here they were concerned that i might have a kidney stone
[doctor] okay so i'm guessing you did n't get to go find the eggs on the easter egg hunt because of the you were in pain
[patient] not so much but i i got to participate a little bit i opened some eggs i just did n't go run around and find them

[patient] a little bit yeah
[doctor] a little bit alright so on your exam of your abdomen there is mild pain and tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there's no rebound or guarding there is cva located near your flank tenderness on the right so that means that everything looks good but you do have what seems to be some inflammation of your kidney okay so we we were able to get a ct of your your side and it showed that you do have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size and it's located in the proximal right ureter and so that's that duck that passes from your kidney to your bladder alright i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so that means that there's not obstructing ureter causing swelling in your kidney which is which is pretty good so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone on the right so what i'm recommending is i want you to push fluids just to help facilitate you passing that stone alright have you been taking in have you been drinking enough water do you think so far
[patient] probably not enough i drink some but
[doctor] okay yeah i i want you to to drink try drink as much as possible just to see if we can get you hydrated and pass the stone what i'm gon na do is i'm gon na prescribe you ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams you can take that as needed for pain i know you said you were in that much pain just in case it does start to move you're in pain i want you to take the ibuprofen i'm also gon na give you a strainer for you to strain your pee so we can see you wan na know when that that stone does pass gon na order a bmp and a urinalysis and a urine culture and based on what the urinalysis shows we can decide if i can decide if i need to put you on antibiotics if you do have an infection of some kind and i wan na see you back in about a week to two weeks and if you're still having symptoms we can discuss further treatment such as a lithotripsy and it's it's a mainly minimally invasive procedure where we use shock waves to try to break up that stone but otherwise do you have any other questions for me

[patient] yeah it's still quite a problem you know something i've been suffering with for so long now it's still quite itchy and it's really embarrassing too because i'll have dandruff so much like all over me but but i just ca n't stop itching
[doctor] okay when did you first notice this
[patient] i wan na say it's been a while but probably worsening in the past like six months or so
[doctor] okay okay and have you seen ever noticed any rashes either when it first started or intermittently anywhere else
[patient] on my body no not really
[doctor] okay okay just mainly up underneath your on your scalp there uh and i can i can see that man that looks really itchy and scaly have you died your hair recently or used any other chemicals you you know like a new hair spray or gel
[patient] nothing new i mean i do dye my hair but i've been doing that for years now but otherwise i do n't really use a lot of products in my hair
[doctor] yeah i you know it's funny you say that because i keep saying i earned this gray hair and i'm gon na keep it so yeah have you tried any over the counter treatments i know there is a lot out of there something you know like a t gel or any of those other have those helped
[patient] yeah i did that i did head and shoulders i even tried some castor oil and but none of them really seemed to be helping
[doctor] okay okay let's talk about some other symptoms any joint pain fever weight loss
[patient] not that i can recall i've been pretty good otherwise
[doctor] okay good and going back you know to your grandparents has anybody else in the family had similar symptoms that you're aware of
[patient] no well maybe my sister
[doctor] maybe your sister okay
[patient] yeah maybe my sister i mean i know she'll is no one has as bad as i do but she does report like just having a dry scalp

[doctor] okay i'm gon na do a quick physical exam now your vitals look good and i would like to do a focused exam of your right foot the there is some bruising on the bottom part of your foot and on the top part as well and i do appreciate the associated swelling and i also recognize that you do have tenderness to palpation for midfoot now for your neurovascular exam of your right foot your capillary refill is brisk in less than three seconds i do note a strong bounding dorsalis pedis pulse with motor and sensation is intact for that foot i also like to call out the fact that it matches bilaterally which is important i'm gon na go ahead and review the diagnostic imaging results so we did a x-ray of that right foot and i do notice dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and presence of bony fragments so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to your second metatarsal bone and the top of your foot this is where the metatarsals meet those cuboids okay so it where the bones come together in your foot now there are a lot of ligaments in your foot so i do want to order an mri just to assess if there is any injuries to those ligaments now based on your exam and looking at the x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery now the reason why this is important is if we have poor bone alignment or ligament healing you can this can lead to losing the arch in your foot you could becoming flat-footed and also developing arthritis now what's gon na be key here is the surgery is going to allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly we are going to put them back into place using plates and screws now the key thing is going to be it's going to be outpatient surgery so it's going to be same day i'll see you in the morning and then you'll be discharged home that evening and we will do a follow-up i wan na see you in twenty four hours post procedure but then i'll see you again in two weeks you're gon na be in a cast and i'm gon na have you use crutches you're not gon na be able to weight-bear on that foot for six to eight weeks what we'll do is we'll advance your ambulating gradually based on how you heal and based on how you tolerate the procedure i know i have covered a lot of material quickly but this is really gon na be the best course of action for you to have a good outcome now do you have any questions come answers concerns before i have the nurse come in finish the paperwork and get you set up for your procedure which we are going to do tomorrow if you're agreeable to that
[patient] what about putting in a cast can i just stay in the cast
[doctor] you could but what we found is the best outcome is aligning those bones with plates and screws to make sure that they heal properly so you have the best outcome possible
[patient] so if the surgery is going to be tomorrow when am i going to get my mri
[doctor] so what what we will do is the good news is we have an outpatient mri facility downstairs and i'm going to send the order down and we'll get you your mri this afternoon
[patient] can i think about it and we have some time
[doctor] sure

[patient] no i mean when it happens she just continues playing or doing whatever she was doing when it happens
[doctor] okay alright has she has she otherwise been feeling okay since this started has she been acting normally
[patient] i i'd say she seems fine i mean she has been eating well and playing with her friends and she goes about her normal activities really
[doctor] okay good
[patient] never even though anything was going on
[doctor] okay alright good so has has karen had any seizures in the past
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay and then so tell me when the twitch occurs do you ever notice any you know parts of her like moving or twitching
[patient] well no uh it's just her face
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean the whole side of her face moves when it happens it seems like it several seconds and then it finally stops and she just seems to be blinking frequently and and and you know wait a minute i i did make a video so you can see just in case it does n't do it during the visit
[doctor] okay okay yeah that would be great to see that because i wan na see what's going on so thank you for that tell me is there any family history of seizures or like tourette's syndrome
[patient] well no history of seizures but i i i never heard of that tourette thing
[doctor] yeah so so toret is that it's a nervous system disorder that you know involves like repetitive movements or like unwanted sounds and it typically begins in childhood and i do n't know have you noticed anything like that with her when she was younger
[patient] really i had nobody in our family got anything like that
[doctor] okay now tell me have you noticed any other symptoms how about like fever or chills
[patient] no
[doctor] okay coughing headache
[patient] ma'am
[doctor] okay how about any problems with karen's sleep
[patient] nope
[doctor] okay okay good let's go ahead and do physical exam on karen here alright karen i'm just gon na take a look at you and and ask you to follow some commands okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright can you follow my finger with your eyes good now can you do me a favor walk across the room for me great job okay now i want you to close your eyes and reach out your arms in front of you good now keep your eyes closed can you feel me touch you here how about okay how about there
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] does that feel the same
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay alright so i'm just gon na check your reflexes okay alright now on your on the neurological exam the patient is awake alert and oriented times three speech is clear and fluent gait is steady heel toe walking is normal and the cranial nerves are intact without focal neurologic findings there is no pronator drift sensation is intact reflexes are two plus and symmetric at the biceps triceps knees and ankles so this means everything looks good karen
[patient] that's great
[doctor] good alright so i'm gon na go ahead and tell you what we're gon na do so i'm gon na tell you my assessment and plan here so dad so for the first problem i do believe that karen does have a tick eye tics are very common in children and as many as you know one in five children have a tick during their school years and tics can also include things like shoulder shrugging facial grimacing sniffling excessive throat clearing and uncontrolled vocalization i can say that essentially they're brief sudden and involuntary motor movements now we do n't have a full understanding of the cause of the tics but they typically occur around five to ten years of age but most ticks go away on their own and they disappear within a year so these are what we call transient tics and the best thing to do is ignore the tics so it does n't seem to be bothering karen and she seems to be doing well in school and activities so it may wax and wane over time but you might notice it more towards the end of the day when the child is tired so you may also you know see it if they're stressed so that's why it's important to just ignore it now when you draw attention to the tick it does make the child conscious so that can make the tic worse so we want to be careful again just to to kind of not to draw too much attention on it and do you have any questions for me
[patient] so you mean you're telling me you do n't think he had a seizure or a bit or nothing
[doctor] yeah i do n't think it's i do n't think so because it's it is the same part of her body that's moving every time that and she reports that it's somewhat of an there is an urge to blink her eye and some relief afterwards
[patient] so you're not recommending any kind of treatment there is no pill or cream or nothing
[doctor] not at this time because she seems to be doing well overall and the tic has n't impacted her school or her activities but if it worsens then we can consider some treatment okay
[patient] alright alright sounds good

aci_D2N056_nan,"[patient] alright thanks for coming in today i see on my chart here that you had a bunch of lower respiratory infections so first tell me how are you what's going on
[doctor] you know i'm doing better now but you know last week i was really sick and i just have had enough like i was coughing a lot a lot of mucus even had some shortness of breath and even a low-grade fever
[patient] wow that is a lot so what did you do for some of those symptoms
[doctor] you know i ended up drinking a lot of fluid and taking some robitussin and i actually got better over the weekend and now i'm feeling much better but what concerns me is that i i tend to get pneumonia a lot
[patient] okay so when you say a lot like how frequently does it occur i would say it seem honestly it seems like it's every month or every other month especially over the past six six months that i just keep getting sick and i usually will end up having to go to my primary care doctor or
[doctor] urgent care and i'll get prescribed some antibiotics and one time i actually ended up in the emergency room
[patient] wow and how long do your symptoms normally last for
[doctor] you know it could be as few as like a couple of days but sometimes it could go even up to a week
[patient] mm-hmm you mentioned that you are a farmer did you do you notice that your symptoms occur while doing certain things on the farm
[doctor] you know i was trying to think about that and i've been working on the farm for some time but the only thing i can think about is that i've been helping my brother out and i've been started like unloading a lot of hay which i do n't usually do and i wan na say that my symptoms actually start the days that i'm unloading hay
[patient] alright do you wear a mask when you're unloading hay
[doctor] no i do n't do that
[patient] okay
[doctor] none of us do
[patient] okay yeah so like that your brother does n't either
[doctor] no i'm the only one who seems to be getting sick
[patient] alright so i know you said you were trying to like help out your brother like what's going on with him
[doctor] you know we've just been getting really busy and so he has been working around doing other things so i've just been helping him just cover the extra load
[patient] mm-hmm okay alright do you have any other siblings
[doctor] yeah there is actually ten of us
[patient] wow okay that's that's a lot of siblings
[doctor] yeah i'm okay
[patient] maybe maybe we could we could always stick them in they could get some work done the holidays must be fun at your place
[doctor] yeah we do n't need to hire any i mean have anyone else this is our family
[patient] you're right keep it in the family okay so speaking of family do you have do you or anyone have a history of seasonal allergies
[doctor] no no i have never had any problems with allergies
[patient] okay and do you smoke
[doctor] i do n't smoke
[patient] do you live with anybody who does
[doctor] i do not
[patient] okay alright so okay so now i i wan na go ahead and do my physical exam i'm gon na call out some of my findings just to make sure that i'm documenting everything and if you have any questions about what it is that i'm saying please feel free to ask okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] so i reviewed your vitals and you appear to be breathing a little fast your respiratory rate is twenty but but your oxygen is you're satting kind of fine at ninety nine percent on room air so i'm not too worried about that on for on your heart exam i do you have a regular rate and regular rhythm i do not appreciate any murmurs rubs or gallops on your lung exam you know i do you do have some fine rales on your lung exam but no wheezes and on your musculoskeletal exam i do not appreciate any clubbing of your fingers so for your results i did review the results of your chest x-ray and i noticed some round glass opacities so let me tell you a little bit about like my assessment and plan for your first problem of recurrent lung infections your symptoms seem consistent with a condition we call hypersensitivity pneumonitis in your case another name is farmer's lung which you know is appropriate considering your job this could be caused by bacteria and or mold that is found in the hay when you inhale it it leads to an allergic reaction in your lungs this is why your symptoms occur every time you move hay for your current symptoms i'm gon na prescribe you a a course of an oral steroid this will help to decrease the inflammation that is occurring in your lungs i will also be ordering a cat scan of your lungs which will help confirm the diagnosis as as well a pulmonary function test to assess how severe your respiratory impairment is it would be best if you could eliminate your exposure to the hay or prevent further to prevent further damage to your lungs however if you are unable it's very important that you wear a respirator when moving hay around i know that that was a lot of information i think it boils down to pull in more of your siblings to help work around but do you have any questions
[doctor] yeah so is this gon na help so i do n't keep getting sick
[patient] so ideally what we are doing i think this is the best course of action to deal with the deeper problem right of these infections and to kind of like clear up the pneumonia everything seems to hint on so what we're gon na do is treat your current infection we're going to either prevent you from being around hay or make it so that it's safe for you to be with hay and then we're gon na see like what we need to do moving forward does that help
[doctor] okay it does

[doctor] okay
[patient] so at this point what would i do if i'm going out of the room and then coming back
[doctor] you could hit pause or hit the stop button and just restart it the next time you come in
[patient] okay alrighty so taking a look at your x-ray and you do have you you have a large spur there on the top of your big toe joint
[doctor] oh
[patient] and you've lost a lot of the cartilage
[doctor] oh
[patient] and so you you've got some arthritis in there we we call this hallux rigidus and treatment for this to start off with we we put an insert in your shoe called an orthotic and we give you a little bit of anti-inflammatory medication or like a drug called meloxicam you only have to take it once a day
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's usually pretty well tolerated have you ever had any trouble with your stomach
[doctor] no never never had any problems with my stomach i love the i love the mexican's food the hotter the better so i hope i never get a problem with my stomach
[patient] i hope you do n't either one of the things that we get concerned about with an anti-inflammatory like that is that it can irritate the stomach so if you do start to notice that you're getting heartburn or pain right there
[doctor] yeah
[patient] below your your sternum you would need to stop taking the medicine and give me a call
[doctor] okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i wan na see you back in two weeks to see how you're doing with that if you're not seeing significant improvement then we may have to talk about doing things that are a little more invasive like doing a shot
[doctor] okay
[patient] or even surgery to clean out the joint sometimes
[doctor] is that surgery
[patient] i have to
[doctor] would that be
[patient] i'm sorry
[doctor] would that be surgery clean out the joint
[patient] yeah that would
[doctor] okay
[patient] that would be surgery if if we went in and cleaned out the joint sometimes in really severe cases we even just have to fuse the big toe joint we put it in a position of optimal function and we fuse it there and then your pain goes away you lose some motion but you've already lost quite a bit of motion and and the pain goes away so that that surgery really is very effective but let's try to run from my knife a little bit longer
[doctor] okay well you know i do n't think i'm gon na be able to do my work job i'm on my feet every day and i it's and and quite frankly it's fishing season so do you think you can give me a couple weeks off so i can get out and get some fishing done
[patient] no i want you to be doing your regular activities i want to know how this because if i put you out of work can you come back in and say it feels better well is was it because of the treatment or because of the rest so no i want you to keep working i want you to do your regular activities and i really want you to put these orthotics to the test and this medicine to the test and we will see how you're doing in two weeks
[doctor] okay where i really like catching blue going croppy so okay we'll we'll i'll i'll keep working then i'll find time to do that later
[patient] very good we will see you in two weeks

[patient] good morning
[doctor] good morning thanks doctor doctor cooper i'm i'm you know i'm a little i'm sad to be in here but you know thanks for taking me in i appreciate it
[patient] sure absolutely what can i help you with today
[doctor] so you know i've been dealing with my asthma and like i tried to join sports but it's really kind of it's getting hard you know and i i i just wonder if there's something that can be done because i really do like playing water polo
[patient] but i'm having difficulty breathing sometimes i've had to like you know stop matches and sit on the side just to kind of like catch my breath and use my inhaler so i was wondering if there was something we could do about it
[doctor] and then like i'm kind of a little bit worried i think my mood is getting a little a little worrisome and i i wanted to explore like what my options were
[patient] okay let's talk about the asthma first so what inhaler are you using now
[doctor] i have an albuterol inhaler
[patient] okay and when when you're having trouble it's usually just around sports that is it keeping you up at night
[doctor] so i do n't really like wake up at night a lot typically like it's sports like you know if i'm doing anything like crazy aerobic or like running or anything i do notice that if any if i'm around smoke i do start coughing a little bit but most of the time it's sports
[patient] okay and can you describe a little bit for me what happens
[doctor] i start to yeah no so i start to feel like there is like some phlegm building up in my in my throat and i start coughing like my chest gets tight i start wheezing and i just have to sit down or else i'm gon na get like lightheaded too
[patient] okay and then when you use your inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] does it does it alleviate the problem
[doctor] so yeah it helps with that like phlegm feeling you know but i still i still have to sit down you know and like breathe and then the thing that i hate about that inhaler is i start getting like shaky is that supposed to be happening
[patient] yes that is unfortunately normal and a side effect with the inhaler
[doctor] okay
[patient] so you use you're using two puffs of the inhaler
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for the symptoms
[doctor] yes
[patient] and then you sit down and does it does it get better within about fifteen minutes or so
[doctor] yeah yeah it does but you know i had to like step out of the the pool to make that happen i'm hoping that there is something else we can do okay have you ever taken any daily medications for your asthma an inhaler or singulair or anything like that no i i just use my inhaler whenever i have an attack
[patient] okay so that's something we might wan na consider but how often is it happening
[doctor] pretty much every time i do any kind of aerobic workout
[patient] okay and outside of physical activity you're not having any problems
[doctor] yeah there's that part where like if i'm around somebody who has been smoking a lot or is currently smoking but i usually just step away i do n't even like to be around them you know that makes sense
[patient] alright well we will look at that tell me about the mood issues you are having
[doctor] yeah so one of the reasons i got into like trying to get into sports is like i feel like you know you you feel a lot more energized and a lot you know happier but like lately i've just been kinda stressed out you know like i have i have like sats that i need to study for i've got like all these ap classes you know there's just it i feel like there's a lot of pressure and you know like i get it but there are times where i'm just like really down and i i do n't really know what else i can do
[patient] okay that makes sense any any difficulty with focusing or you're having difficulty retaining information or is it more feeling sad not having motivation
[doctor] so i think it's like a lot of sadness a lot of like you know i do n't really i kinda feel like you know i do n't really like want to do anything you know my friends will go out and i'll just be like i'd rather be at home i am really tired a lot too
[patient] okay alright well let me let me go ahead and check you out
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then we can talk a little bit more
[doctor] okay
[patient] i'm gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and everything sounds good
[doctor] let me take a look at your eyes
[patient] mm-hmm and in your ears everything looks okay have you had any problems with allergies you have seasonal allergies or anything like that
[doctor] yeah i think so yeah
[patient] i do see just a little bit of fluid in the ears
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i'm gon na look in your mouth too
[doctor] okay
[patient] and throat looks fine no tonsils
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] lem me go ahead and have you lay back on the table and i'll take a listen to your stomach
[doctor] okay
[patient] everything sounds okay i'm gon na feel around just to make sure everything feels normal
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] everything feels fine and i'm gon na check reflexes and they're all normal
[doctor] awesome
[patient] it's really hard to do with actual patient so in terms of the asthma i think we could try a daily medication since it looks like you might be having a little bit of allergies maybe we can try some singulair
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and start with that once you are on that daily and you can continue to use the albuterol inhaler those side effects unfortunately you're right it's it's just one of the expected side effects with an albuterol inhaler i would recommend just what you're doing just sit down for a little bit after you take it
[doctor] and we will get you started on the singulair probably within about a month you should see a difference so i will have you come back in about six weeks and follow up and see how you're doing with that
[patient] in terms of the mood is this new for you
[doctor] yeah i think so like when i started this year
[patient] and it sounds like related to school expectations and the stress with saps and all of that
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay let's consider having you start seeing a therapist i think that would be a good place to start
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and we will do some screening questionnaires and and then follow up in a couple weeks on that too

[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

[patient] i was playing basketball and jerry ran into me and the inside of my knee hurts
[doctor] okay did you fall to the ground or did you just kinda plant and he pushed and you went one way and your knee did n't
[patient] i did fall to the ground
[doctor] you did fall to the ground okay and did you land on the kneecap i mean did it hurt a lot were you able to get up and continue on
[patient] i landed on my side i was not able to continue on
[doctor] okay so you get off the off the court is jerry a good player you just got ta ask that question
[patient] not really
[doctor] no
[patient] he does n't have much game
[doctor] okay okay well you know i love basketball i'm a little short for the game but i absolutely love to watch basketball so it's really cool that you're out there playing it so tell me about a little bit about where it hurts
[patient] on the inside
[doctor] on the inside of it okay and after the injury did they do anything special for you or you know did you get ice on it right away or try anything
[patient] i had ice and an ace wrap
[doctor] you had ice and what
[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly
[patient] seven
[doctor] seven days ago okay yeah your right knee still looks a little swollen for seven days ago so i'm gon na go ahead and now i also see that you're diabetic and that you take five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day are you still you're still on that medication is that correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and when i push on this inside where it's a little swollen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay i'm just gon na ask a question did you hear or feel a pop in your knee when you were doing this
[patient] i did not no
[doctor] you did not okay okay what are you doing for the pain today
[patient] some exercises ice and mobic
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just played the wife with fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment
[patient] yeah they do

[doctor] okay alright yeah but yeah i can feel it here so it does feel a little bit warm so i said you've been in a little bit of pain so have you taken anything for it
[patient] well like last night i iced it and i kept it elevated you know i also took some ibuprofen last night and this morning
[doctor] alright has the ibuprofen helped at all

[doctor] okay got it alright well i'll i'll examine you in a second but before we do that let's talk about some of the other conditions that we're kinda following you for i'm looking at your problem list now and you've got a history of diabetes and you're on metformin five hundred milligram twice a day and your how are you doing with your blood sugars and your and your diet and exercise
[patient] yeah i i check my sugar two or three times a week most of the time it's in that one twenty to one forty range
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah i take my medicine okay my diet is alright you know i could be fifteen pounds lighter that would be alright but
[doctor] sure
[patient] i i i think the sugar has been okay
[doctor] okay we checked your hemoglobin a1c last time i'm looking at your records in epic and it showed that it was you know seven . one so it's it's it's good but it could be better any you know we talked about it controlling your diet or improving your diet and trying to have a balanced meal and not eating some of these sweets and high sugar items how is that going i know you had talked about your wife being a great cook and making cookies and that's hard to stay away from obviously how are things going with that
[patient] yeah she still makes cookies and i still eat them but you know we are trying to trying to do better trying to stay away from more of those carbs and focus on you know less carby less sweet stuff
[doctor] okay alright yeah that's always a struggle i certainly understand but you know really important with your diabetes just to prevent some of the complications like kidney failure and eye problems and just keep your sugar under balance so i'll order another hemoglobin a1c today we'll check that again today and and you know just reemphasizing the controlling your diet and exercise is super important and then we'll have those results back we'll we'll see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] for your high blood pressure your blood pressure in the clinic looks pretty good it's about one twenty over seventy right now we have you on norvasc five milligrams once a day how are things going with that are you are you checking that periodically or any issues with that at all
[patient] yeah i guess i check it maybe once a week or two or three times a month and it it the vast majority of the time when i check it it's good usually either that one twenty to one thirty over seventy to eighty range i i think the blood pressure's okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] i have n't had any real problems there i i have had some some swelling in my ankles though
[doctor] okay is that new or is that been going on for a while
[patient] well it it started maybe i do n't know a month or two after i started the norvasc
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was just wondering if the two might be related
[doctor] yeah i mean certainly it could be it is you know sometimes that medication can cause that so i'll i'll examine you in a second and see if we need to make any modifications okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so and your anything else bothering you today
[patient] no i'm we're doing okay i think
[doctor] so let me examine you for a second i'm gon na go ahead and gabriel i'm gon na do my magic exam now let's pretend i i'm just gon na verbalize some of my findings as i do my exam and so
[patient] these are like my video visit exams
[doctor] exactly so your neck exam has no jvd there is no bruits that i can hear your lung exam no rales no wheezing on your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past so i'm not too worried about that otherwise regular rate and rhythm on your heart exam on your on your on your belly exam is nice and soft on your back exam you do have some tenderness on the left paraspinal area right where i'm pressing right there your straight leg raise test is negative your reflexes are normal you have some just some tenderness in the lower back in the paraspinal area of your back when i palpate there otherwise your neurological exam is normal on your extremity exam you do have this one plus nonpitting edema of your lower extremities which is a little bit of swelling in your ankles no calf tenderness negative homans sign no signs of blood clot that's what that means so let me just review what you know explain what all this means so the back pain the first problem that you're here today for i think this is more of a muscular sprain i'm gon na recommend we start you on some anti-inflammatory naprosyn five hundred five hundred milligrams twice a day and flexeril ten milligrams twice a day as well i'm gon na refer you to for for physical therapy to help strengthen some of the muscles in your lower back i do n't think you need an x-ray at this stage why do n't we start with physical therapy and the muscle relaxers and the pain medicines if it does n't get better then we can get an x-ray but right now i would start with that if that's okay with you any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay for the diabetes the the second problem that we talked about today i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day why do n't we have you come back in about two weeks and we should have some of the results back and we can discuss if we need to make any modifications for that but right now we will continue the course and we will go from there okay for the high blood pressure you do have this one plus edema in your legs i'm gon na go ahead and order some blood work today i'm gon na go ahead and stop the norvasc and we'll put you on some hydrochlorothiazide ten milligrams once a day and if that does n't get if the swelling does n't go away i'm gon na do some more testing for right now let's get some sort off with some cbc and a bmp i'm gon na check your kidney function i'm gon na get another ekg and also i'm gon na get a chest x-ray and we'll go from there but hopefully this will go away once we stop this medication since it started around that time okay okay and i think that's it anything else we forgot about do you need refills for anything

[doctor] okay alright and then have you had any hospitalizations or surgeries in the past
[patient] well i had surgery on my right knee before
[doctor] okay so you've had surgery before alright do you remember what kind of surgery
[patient] i do n't know they told me they reconstructed the whole thing i was fourteen i was a really good gymnast back then really good
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i was doing a back summer salt and i felt a pop then and then since that time i've really had problems with my knee
[doctor] uh uh
[patient] but you know the athlete that i am i can still really ski very well so i just kept going
[doctor] okay
[patient] and i'm really tough my pain tolerance is very high
[doctor] okay okay okay how so do you have any other exercises that i might wan na know about outside of intense gym and ski events
[patient] no i think that's about it
[doctor] okay and how frequently do you normally ski
[patient] i ski probably three times a week
[doctor] okay and then are you on any medications at this time other than the thc
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright what
[patient] nothing no
[doctor] okay alright not a problem so if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my examination i'm just gon na call it out for the sake of being able to document it appropriately and you or just just let me know if you want me to explain anything further so with your knee i know that you said it hurts on the right inside a lot right so when i press on the inside of your knee does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and when i press on the outside of your left of your right knee sorry does that hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright so when i move your your kneecap does that hurt
[patient] no it kinda makes a shooting pain down to my ankle though
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it does n't hurt my knee
[doctor] okay so does the pain radiate frequently
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] i've never really noticed it just messed with my kneecap
[doctor] okay alright on your skin exam i do appreciate some mild swelling and bruising that's really interesting since it's been two weeks with your knee are you able to bend it
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then when you walked in on your gait i think i think i did appreciate a slight limp are you i i i i think you are you are protecting one of your knees does that sound familiar
[patient] yeah i waddle pretty pretty good now
[doctor] okay alright and when you move your knee away from your body you're bending like your you're pulling it towards me does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay and then when you pull your knee back towards you does that hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] alright so pain on dorsiflexion but not on plantar flexion plantar flexion okay alright so what we are gon na do right now i think i'm gon na look at your x-rays but when i when i look at the results of your x-ray i do not appreciate any fracture what i am noticing is the development of a little bit of arthritis and that could explain like why you say that your joints hurt a bit more during like windy weather and what not so this is what we're gon na do for my assessment and plan right the first thing is i think you have a strain of your posterior cruciate ligament what that means is what that will mean for you though is that we are gon na continue to brace your right knee that's gon na hopefully take off some of the stress that you might be putting on it especially since you're limping i am going to recommend you for physical therapy i think it would be an i think it's a good idea to maybe start three times a week to get your strength back into your knee i would recommend not skiing or doing any gymnastics for now and i think that physical therapy will really help considering the injury that you had when you were fourteen i'm gon na prescribe you some medications i do n't necessarily recommend consuming gummies at the same time but the medications i'm gon na give you are gon na be meloxicam fifteen milligrams you're gon na take that once a day that will help with like the swelling and the bruising i'm also gon na prescribe you just like a higher strength nsaid so ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams a day you can take that twice a day as needed for your left knee i think you are i think you just kind of like strength a little bit but like not enough to necessarily require any kind of like medication or bracing i think you just take it easy on your body i know that you're like very active from what i hear and i i think that that's really exciting but i think you might need to listen to your body and give yourself a bit of a break you'll be able to do like several workouts when you go to when you go to physical therapy but you know let the yeah let your therapist be your guide about like what you should and should not be putting your body through does that make sense

[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] so carolyn is a 49-year-old female here for follow-up of her chronic problems . so , how are you doing , carolyn ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . um , my osteoarthritis has been flaring up a little bit lately , um , so i wan na get- talk about that primarily . so , it's mostly in um , my elbows and it's really been bothering me . i've been sitting at the computer , at the desk more , um , in the office so i do n't know if it's being stagnant in that position all day has um , increased flare-ups for that , but i wanted to talk to you about that .
[doctor] okay , sure . and , are you right or left-handed ?
[patient] i'm right-handed .
[doctor] okay , and does one elbow bother you more than the other ?
[patient] my right elbow does bother me more than the other , but primarily , i'm typing all day versus writing , so it- it flares up in both .
[doctor] okay . all right , and um , any other joint pain ?
[patient] no , just- just really focused on my elbows .
[doctor] okay , and any numbing or tingling in your hands ?
[patient] uh , sometimes . when i'm typing for long periods of time , i feel a little bit of numbing , um , i try to shake out my arms a little bit . um , just to kind of relieve that um , sensation .
[doctor] okay . all right , and i know that you've had this also , had this history of gout . and the last episode you had was about three months ago . you had some inflammation of your toe . have you had any other issues with that ?
[patient] no , i have n't . um , the medication you gave me really controlled it , and i have n't seen a flare-up since .
[doctor] okay . all right , and how are you doing with your psoriasis ?
[patient] that's been under control too . that has n't been a- a major problem for me either .
[doctor] okay . i- i know that we had given you some clobetasol for your scalp . is that- so that's doing okay ?
[patient] yeah , that's doing a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right , well , i'd like to go ahead and do a physical exam on you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's first look at your vital signs . hey , dragon , show me the vital signs . great , so everything looks good from that perspective . um , so looking at you , i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy . your heart is a nice regular rate and rhythm , and your lungs sound really clear . on your right elbow , you do have some edema and inflammation of your right olecranon and there's some tenderness and an effusion right there . so um , does that hurt when i press it ?
[patient] yeah , that does hurt .
[doctor] okay , and when i turn your arm , do you have pain ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts a bit too .
[doctor] okay , so she has pain- to palpation of the olecranon bursa and pain with pronation and supination . and when you flex- and when you bend it and straighten it , does that hurt ?
[patient] yeah , it does and it's a bit stiff too .
[doctor] okay , so pain with flexion and extension of the right arm . uh , your abdomen is nice and soft , and there's no lower extremity edema . uh , let's go ahead and take a look at some of your labs . you know , you have a lot of arthritis for someone so young , so we had sent off that autoimmune panel . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune labs . hey , dragon . show me the autoimmune profile . hey , dragon . show me the esr . okay , so that's good . hey , dragon . show me the uric acid . okay . all right , well , good . that's great . so , you know , it does n't look like you have any systemic arthritis , or sys- systemic inflammatory in process going on . so , my impression of you at this time is that from a gout standpoint , everything is nice and stable . i think that we should continue you on the colchicine 0.6 milligrams twice a day as needed for flare-ups of your gout . um , and then for your osteoarthritis , i'd like to go ahead and order a right elbow x-ray . hey , dragon . order a right elbow x-ray , and then i'd like to prescribe some meloxicam 15 milligrams once a day for the pain and the swelling .
[patient] okay .

[patient] i've been doing well . i began working in a bakery this summer which has been super fun. i have really been enjoying working there, but i find myself, since i am so close to so many delicious treats, snacking a lot during shifts and eating a lot more desserts than i normally would.
[doctor] okay , so , that brings me to your diabetes . so , how have your blood sugars been ?
[patient] uh , not so good .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] so , they've been up and down because of my diet , i think , because i've been taking my medication as prescribed . um , so , i have n't missed anything there , but my diet has been pretty bad lately .
[doctor] pretty bad lately ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . and , that's really the only thing that's different is your diet , pretty much ?

[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the hemoglobin a1c . okay , so , blood sugars have been elevated . your hemoglobin a1c is elevated as well , so that tells me your blood sugars have been a little bit out of control . you're still taking the metformin , correct ?

[patient] go for it .
[doctor] okay , so rebecca is a 27-year-old female patient . um , you have a history of carpal tunnel , um , uh , release done couple of years ago , you have some chronic back pain , some depression . why am i seeing you today ?
[patient] so last week , um , and over the course of the month , i have taken up swimming more regularly .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've been trying to get up and get active . and i've- ... all of a sudden i've been feeling some really bad , um , knee pain-
[doctor] okay .
[patient] . in my right knee .
[doctor] just in your right knee ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay . just when swimming ? are you swimming freestyle with your legs kicking straight or more like breaststroke where your legs kick out ?
[patient] yeah , it's only while swimming. i use the breaststroke so i guess where the legs are kicking out like a frog ... it kinda starts hurting a little bit after i swim a couple laps , which a month ago when i started i was able to do ten .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but after a couple of laps it starts to hurt .
[doctor] and no injury ? like you did n't fall or twist it or anything like that that you remember ?
[patient] no , not that i can remember .
[doctor] okay . so just swimming a lot and you feeling more and more discomfort ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] okay , good . so , um ... i know my nurse did a review of systems before you came in . there were really no significant issues . you have a history of chronic back pain , that's been doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it comes and goes , but right now it's been doing really well .
[doctor] okay , no pain going down your legs or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . and i know you have some depression , you've been on medication . how's that been going ?
[patient] that's been going really well .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] with the medication and therapy and then trying to get outside more it's been really helping me .
[doctor] sleeping well ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] eating well ? okay . do n't feel any concerns about hurting yourself or others or anything like that ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , good . um , and the , you had ca- carpal tunnel done a few years ago . how's that doing ?
[patient] that's doing-
[doctor] any flare up with that ?
[patient] . that's doing really well . i've been getting full range of motion and it's felt a lot better .
[doctor] okay , great . do you mind if i do a quick exam ?
[patient] yeah , go for it .
[doctor] squeeze my fingers for me . good . okay . is it painful if i move your patella like that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts .
[doctor] okay . and i'm gon na hold your leg out , i'm gon na hold , i want you to stiffen your upper ... does that hurt when i do that ?
[patient] yeah , that hurts too .
[doctor] okay , good , all right . um , let's take a quick look at your x-ray , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the right knee x-ray . okay , so here's a picture of your right knee . actually normal x-ray , everything looks good , okay ? on my exam , um , you do n't really have any swelling in- in your joints , um , uh , of your knee . you have a little pain with , um , uh , range of motion of the knee . you have real pain when we do what we call patella in- ... patellar inhibition , okay ? so that's what caused most of that pain . so , um , your heart is regular , your lungs are clear , i do n't feel any adenopathy , your thyroid's , um , normal , your grips are equal , the rest of your exam is essentially normal , okay ? so my assessment is , you have what we call chondromalacia of the patella , okay ? it's just from the overuse and all- all the swimming you've been doing , okay ? so , um , to treat that we'll just use some anti-inflammatories , um , go ahead and take some ibuprofen , 600 milligrams four times a day with food . i do want you to do some straight leg raising exercises , that'll strengthen your quadriceps and that'll help with that pain , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , basically you want to avoid anything that puts extra pressure on your knees for a little while and it should be fine . if it's not getting any better in a couple weeks i wan na see you again , okay ? so no lunges , avoid the breaststroke . if you're comfortable, you can also do other swimming strokes where your knees are straight instead . or you can take the opportunity to have a little break .

[patient] yes . so , i've been eating a ton of sweets recently . with the holidays it just feels like there is always something sweet available. whether i am at work and there are holiday gift baskets or clients bringing in treats or when i visit my family for the holidays and there is every baked good imaginable, there is always something sweet i can be eating. in the beginning i felt fine, but i have started to feel it after a couple of weeks, and this past week i just felt really light-headed and i could ... was seeing spots , really dizzy . so i went into the emergency room and they said i had a high blood sugar . um , so i wanted to come in and follow up with you to get that , um , get checked out .
[doctor] okay . all right . and how , how are you feeling now ? did they , did , did they treat you in the emergency room ? did they gi- they give you some iv fluids and things like that ?
[patient] yeah . they gave me some fluids and they told me just to try to really cut out eating any extra sweets and get back into my normal routine and diet, but i am still staying with my family, and my mom and grandmother are big bakers so i think it will be really hard to get into a routine there so i just want to make sure i am nipping this high blood sugar thing in the bud.
[doctor] okay . and i saw you went through a review of systems sheet with a nurse . i just want to ask you a few more questions from that standpoint . so you have had any fever or chills ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any chest pain or shortness of breath ?
[patient] n- uh , no .

virtscribe_D2N138_nan,"[doctor] next patient is emily hernandez . date of birth , march 26 2001 . this is a 20 year old female being seen today for our yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms , which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy , she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation .
[doctor] hi emily , how are you ?
[patient] i'm pretty good , how are you ?
[doctor] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ?
[patient] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using .
[doctor] okay , and that's the 250/50 dose , correct ?
[patient] yes , correct .
[doctor] perfect . so how does that compare ?
[patient] i mean , it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night .
[doctor] and that's one puff twice a day ?
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ?
[patient] rarely , and if i do it's really just before a workout or something out that , if i know i'm really going to be pushing it .
[doctor] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . so you can do things like go on a walk or going to the grocery store no problem , and just use it for more exertional stuff ?
[patient] yes . like , if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon .
[doctor] no kidding , that's great .
[patient] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler .
[doctor] really ?
[patient] yeah , and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler it makes it easier .
[doctor] and so by inhaler do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ?
[patient] mm-hmm . so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test , and then they'll see how the asthma affects me . and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less . and really some days i feel like i do n't need it .
[doctor] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week do you use one puff in the morning and one puff at night ?
[patient] probably about three or four .
[doctor] okay , three to four days per week and the other days it's once a day ?
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it .
[doctor] okay , and do you think that's working okay ?
[patient] i do .
[doctor] great . and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then .
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . and now , military wise , what's the time frame of when you'll be completing some of these exertional tests ? like , what are your next steps ?
[patient] so , hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring of 2022 . so that gives me about six to seven months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler . or at least show them that i have it under control .
[doctor] now when you were in the other room you completed a breathing test , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , 'cause i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer and fall , correct ?
[patient] yeah , i do n't really ... um , or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall . i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer .
[doctor] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ?
[patient] yeah , that's right .
[doctor] okay . and have you been taking the zyrtec every day recently since you're right in the mix of spring ?
[patient] not every day , but i do take it on days i know i'm going to be outside a lot . um , i do tend to work outside about three days a week so i'll definitely take it on those days .
[doctor] and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ?
[patient] yeah , it does , it works great .
[doctor] wonderful , good to hear . and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts . uh , last year you had told me it worked with ... uh , you worked with enterprise rent-a-car and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives , uh , when you had touched it , is that correct ?
[patient] yep , that's correct .
[doctor] okay . and has there been anything like that since that experience ?
[patient] no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that , so i usually wear , uh , wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now . so i have n't had a reaction , but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that had peanuts in them , but they just d- did n't touch my skin .
[doctor] super . and it sounds like you're really smart about it .
[patient] yeah , and the airplanes , they have peanuts . they give everyone too , so .
[doctor] okay . and you have an epipen that k- that you keep with you , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills , um , i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course , they expire within a year .
[patient] yeah , okay .
[doctor] and i remember , um , sometime previously you've had some testing for tree nuts , but you do have almonds and cashews , correct ? and- and you do okay with them , or do you avoid all tree nuts ?
[patient] i do tend to avoid all of them but i recall eating some almonds at one point , uh , really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and i remember having them and nothing happened , but i usually just tend to stay away from them , um , really if i can help it .
[doctor] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , so it is very common to avoid both . um , so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great we can work on getting you , uh , something lower than wixela . if you look at all of our asthma regimens it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one . and , well maybe you do n't need both of'em . uh , maybe you just need one of'em . so we can work our way backwards .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and so the breathing test will help give us some- some more guidance , we will look at the results in just a moment .
[patient] all right , and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good , and , um , now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit . so i am sure that might have an effect .
[doctor] it can . um , so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results , probably before you started smoking or using the vape .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] yeah . and we'll see where you stand at that point .
[patient] all right , that sounds good .
[doctor] well let me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth ? big ahh .
[patient] ahh .
[doctor] good . okay let me take a peek in your nose . all right , good . you can put your mask back on .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and go ahead take a big breath in and out . good , your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart , breathe quietly . okay very good .
[patient] awesome .
[doctor] so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple years ago , and actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember but when we last completed the test in 2019 , uh , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ?
[patient] i think it was the smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking out the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke .
[doctor] yes , you're absolutely right , that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here's what i think , so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ?
[patient] correct .
[doctor] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use .
[patient] yeah i do know that .
[doctor] okay so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off-label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day , so that's an option . option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med .
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco , though , is that it would be two puffs in the morning and two puffs at night . so it's a bit more work . um , it's not breath activated but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that were published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill , or say during smoke season . so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting
[ inaudible 00:09:25 ] sick having issues every month , then that would indicate would pull back too much .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] that we had too much , yeah .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers , uh , when you're ill or it's smoke season , but at the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco .
[patient] okay , that actually sounds really good .
[doctor] okay great . so i will call that in for you , it will be the lower dose , 80 mcg , and you'll have to do two puffs twice a day .
[patient] all right
[doctor] okay and that'll be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you .
[patient] okay , got it .
[doctor] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in four months to see how you're doing , and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes , not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ?
[patient] yeah i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser permanente broadway .
[doctor] okay perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well .
[patient] awesome , thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . uh , then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or do get- do you get it as a prescription ?
[patient] i just get it over the counter .
[doctor] okay got it . and do you have a nebulizer that you would , uh , need refills on ?
[patient] i do n't think i need any refills , i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis , or there was few select times when i had to use it when i was kid .
[doctor] okay good . well i think we have our game plan .
[patient] okay awesome .
[doctor] and do the alvesco two puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it . the zyrtec 10 milligrams as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen .
[patient] okay
[doctor] all right so we've got it .
[patient] great .
[doctor] all right i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say four months re-check for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer- spirometry at that time .
[patient] okay sounds good .
[doctor] all right well thanks so much and you have a great day .

virtscribe_D2N139_nan,"[doctor] all right , new patient , jordan roberts . date of birth : 3/2/1972 . he's a 49 year old , uh hm , with hypertension and palpitations . please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1st , 2021 .
[doctor] hello mr. roberts , how are you doing today ?
[patient] i'm fine , thank you .
[doctor] good . good . so , i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations .
[patient] yeah . that was back in march i think , but my girlfriend and i , we talked about it , and on that day i had a few cups of coffee , and no breakfast . so , i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else .
[doctor] yeah . have you , uh , have you felt it again since ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , so tell me about the blood pressure then .
[patient] well , i've had issues with my blood pressure since i was young .
[doctor] do you have a family history of this ?
[patient] yeah . a lot of my family does have high blood pressure .
[doctor] i see .
[patient] yeah , i thought it was getting better , and , uh , i have a new primary doctor , and she put me on a new medication about a month ago .
[doctor] uh , can you tell me which medications you're taking ?
[patient] my new med is , uh , a combo med , something 40-25 .
[doctor] okay . um . yes , i see that in your chart . the benicar hct . it has hydrochlorothiazide in it .
[patient] yeah , that's it . my water pill i call it .
[doctor] okay . are you still taking the amlodipine , 10 milligrams daily ?
[patient] uh , yes i am .
[doctor] that's- that's a good start on a regimen . are you checking your blood pressure at home , and if yes , what numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] um , every day .
[doctor] awesome .
[patient] yeah . every morning , i take it when i get up , and it's been running at about , uh , 146 to 155 lately .
[doctor] so you're not down in the 120s yet ?
[patient] no , not yet . well , we're trying to get there though .
[doctor] okay . uh , how are you doing with your salt intake ?
[patient] i'm trying to back off of it . i think i'm doing good with it , not eating too much .
[doctor] good , uh , it plays a huge part in lowering your pressure and , uh , staying away from salt is important . um , i'll give you some information on the dash eating plan , which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] are you doing any exercise ?
[patient] i do try to walk on the treadmill when i can .
[doctor] okay , great . um , all right . so , let's take a look .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] uh , you're gon na hear me talk throughout your exam , just so i can make sure i get everything documented .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so , use my general physical exam template . let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] your heart and lungs sound good , so that's great .
[patient] good to hear .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and lie down . uh , and let me know if anywhere i press hurts .
[patient] nope . nowhere .
[doctor] all right . so , i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . it all looks good . go ahead and sit up . so , in terms of getting that pressure down , you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down . and , the question is what do we need to do to get your- to get it down . uh , your potassium one week ago was 4.0 . uh , has it been redone since in the last week ?
[patient] uh , no .
[doctor] okay . uh , four is good for your potassium level , some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in their body , uh , often it is a form , uh , hormonal response . if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age , eight out of 10 would respond to reduced salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure . but , for the two out of 10 , there is something else driving it , uh , parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands overproduce , um , aldosterone , which we call hyperaldosterone .
[patient] okay . so , is there something we can do about it ?
[doctor] um , in these cases , there's medicine called , uh , spironolactone , that is very effective at dropping the ald- aldosterone level , and your blood pressure , and i think we should give that a try .
[patient] all right . i mean , i'm willing to give it a try .
[doctor] okay . so , let's discuss the piss- the possible risk of , uh , being on hydrochlorothiazide , which is the fluid med that you're now on . and , the spironolactone . one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance . um , they can also cause dehydration . so , when ... so , you got ta make sure that you hydrate . if you do not hydrate , and you get dehydrated , you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up . um , second thing is the spironolactone can raise your potassium too far , it's rare , but it can . uh , you're starting with your potassium at four , so that gives us some room .
[patient] all right . i guess that makes me feel a little bit better .
[doctor] yeah . and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrocholorozide- chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down . now , this does not mean- mean that you need to be eating more salt , okay ? but , it does mean that you will need to do blood tests in two weeks to make sure that it's okay .
[patient] all right . no , that i can do . um , are there any other side effects i need to worry about ?
[doctor] uh , dizziness possibly , as well as , uh , one in 100 guys might develop tenderness in their chest , swollen breasts , or enlarged breasts . this is a rare side effect , um , called gynecomastia , and if it happens , you just cut the medication and you let me know , but it is very uncommon .
[patient] i'll definitely let you know if that happens .
[doctor] okay . uh , we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better . um , it can be tricky when your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age though , it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged . um , same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger , uh , and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure , it can eventually lead to heart failure .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] yeah , so getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure , strokes , and- and things like that- that you're at high risk for with high blood pressure .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , the american heart association has a website called heart.org , it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach- to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise . um , if you do your treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days , that could be seven to 10 points off your blood pressure .
[patient] really ? i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , yeah . it's very important to be active , lower your salt , and increase your potassium . um , the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 milligrams a day , the actual recommendation is- is 1500 milligrams per day , but most people have a hard time with that . um , so just take a look at the website and the dash diet information . um , that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning about this stuff .
[patient] okay . i'll definitely check that out .
[doctor] all right . so , we'll try the spironolactone and schedule a followup in two weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes . uh , if the new med does n't work , the next up is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] all right . so , there they will look into secondary causes of your hypertension . they have access to newer procedure based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication , uh , for example , there is something called a renal , uh , denervation , uh , where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up . when they do that , they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure .
[patient] that's interesting .
[doctor] yeah . so , that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points . um , there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate . uh , but we'll cross that road , uh , when we need to , and let's just- let's just see how you do with the addition of the medication .
[patient] sounds good to me .
[doctor] all right . so , we will see you in two weeks then .
[patient] sounds good . thanks doc .
[doctor] yeah , you're welcome . let me know if you have any questions .
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . have a great day mr. roberts .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension . he's on three meds and maximum dose . i have added spironolactone to his regiment . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he will have a metabolic panel and blood pressure check in two weeks . uh , next medication would be carvedilol , uh , which i try to avoid giving , it's potential for erectile dysfunction . i have talked to the patient about that , and the potential side effects of spironolactone , including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances . if he is not controlled on spironolactone , the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","S (Subjective):

The patient has not had his potassium level rechecked in the last week.

The clinician considers the patient to have resistant hypertension.

The clinician plans to start the patient on spironolactone.

The clinician informed the patient that spironolactone is effective at lowering aldosterone and blood pressure.

The clinician counseled the patient that hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can affect electrolyte balance.

The clinician counseled the patient that hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can cause dehydration.

The clinician advised the patient to maintain adequate hydration while on hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone.

The clinician counseled the patient that dehydration may cause dizziness when standing up.

The clinician counseled the patient that spironolactone can rarely raise potassium too high.

The clinician noted that a starting potassium of 4.0 provides some safety margin for spironolactone.

The clinician advised that low sodium from these medications does not mean the patient should eat more salt.

The clinician instructed the patient to have blood tests in two weeks to check electrolytes.

The clinician counseled the patient that spironolactone may cause dizziness.

The clinician counseled the patient that about one in 100 men on spironolactone may develop breast tenderness, swollen breasts, or enlarged breasts.

The clinician identified gynecomastia as a rare side effect of spironolactone.

The clinician stated that the DASH eating plan has been shown to lower blood pressure.

The clinician plans to try spironolactone and schedule a follow-up in two weeks to check blood pressure and electrolytes.

The clinician stated that if spironolactone does not control the patient’s blood pressure, the next step would be referral to a resistant hypertension clinic.

The clinician explained that the resistant hypertension clinic will evaluate secondary causes of hypertension.

The clinician explained that the resistant hypertension clinic has access to procedure-based technologies to lower blood pressure without medication.

The clinician described renal denervation as a procedure that can lower blood pressure by about 10 points.

The clinician explained that renal denervation involves heating the artery that feeds the kidney to block nerve endings and lower blood pressure.

The clinician noted that renal denervation has risks and not everyone is a candidate.

The clinician documented that the next medication option after spironolactone would be carvedilol.

The clinician stated that carvedilol is avoided when possible because of its potential to cause erectile dysfunction.

virtscribe_D2N140_nan,"[doctor] brittany edwards , 07 , 1898 . she is a return visit for ibs with functional abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting . ms. edwards is a pleasant , 32-year-old female who was last seen in august of 2019 with flares of abdominal pain , who was diagnosed with irritable bowl that was treated with bentyl .
[doctor] she had a previous prescription for reglan that she received from the emergency room that she used as needed for nausea . she was instructed to start a low dose fiber supplement , such as citrucel , daily , probiotics to help with gas and bloating , bentyl up to four times daily for intestinal cramping , and stop reglan and use zofran as needed . neuromodulators such as elavil and buspar were discussed but not started .
[doctor] hello , how are you ?
[patient] i'm okay .
[doctor] good . how have you been feeling ?
[patient] not so good .
[doctor] yeah , so my nurse told me you have been going out to eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp .
[patient] yeah , i have .
[doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that .
[patient] no , it does n't like it at all .
[doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol . and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps , or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea .
[patient] i've been getting both .
[doctor] okay . um , so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ?
[patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day .
[doctor] okay . and are they soft stools or formed stools ?
[patient] um , they're formed .
[doctor] okay . and after you have gone out either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ?
[patient] yeah , i do .
[doctor] okay . do you feel it's the food or the alcohol or both ?
[patient] uh , well usually we go to friday's restaurant . i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo .
[doctor] okay . i can s- i can bet it's the alfredo sauce .
[patient] but it normally does n't bother me .
[doctor] okay . well , pasta can make you bloated , uh , but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chi- uh , grilled chicken is usually all right . alfredo , though , is higher in fat , and it does contain dairy . but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you are there ? is it a sweet drink ?
[patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer patron , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . um , every now and again , i'll drink a martini .
[doctor] sometimes it's the mixer they tend to put in the drinks , but it can be a variety of things . um , so when you're not eating out or drinking , what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular , so when it does flare up , it c- it might not be as bad . um , have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ?
[patient] um , no . i guess i need to find a new drink .
[doctor] okay . and how is it during the week ?
[patient] like what i eat ?
[doctor] yeah , and with the diarrhea and abdomal- um , abdominal pain .
[patient] right now , i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today , though .
[doctor] and was everything all right after that ?
[patient] yeah , for the most part .
[doctor] okay . remember , it's also the portion sizes . so i mean , if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay . you have to just really watch the portions .
[patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out- go without some fried chicken at least once in a while .
[doctor] sounds good . all right , well let's take a look at you today , and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions , and we will discuss once we have finished the exam .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . all right . i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . all right , so if you could just lay back for me , and i'll examine your abdomen .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . do you have any tenderness ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , non-tender . no masses or organomegaly . and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . all right . you can go ahead and sit up now . thank you .
[doctor] all right , so first i want you to try citrucel . it does come in a tablet . you should use it twice daily for regularity . then i would say , if you know you're going out and will possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 milligrams . you can do one tablet before you eat , and then repeat up to four times daily . and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything . um , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later , and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and so your bentyl , that's the anti-spasm medication , and i would take the higher dose .
[patient] can i get a refill of that ?
[doctor] yes , absolutely . uh , so take one tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea , um , i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you are eating and drinking , um , um , about , like , what makes it worse .
[patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas .
[doctor] okay , good . and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time . just plan on drinking plenty of water .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , and you can take it , but before you do , we want to try to reduce the triggers . uh , so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] okay . and so , however , if it is not just these isolated inci- incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long term medication that would take ... that you would take every night . and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ?
[patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether .
[doctor] yeah , there is . and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ?
[patient] that sounds like a much better plan .
[doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that . uh , just take it every night before bedtime .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much .
[doctor] you're welcome . and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else . and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay ?

virtscribe_D2N141_nan,"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson . date of birth 04/12/1934 . mr . watson is- is an 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing sh- shunt surgery , excuse me , on august 1st , 2020 .
[doctor] i have followed mr . watson since may of 2020 when he first presented with eight to ten years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control . we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spino catheter protocol in june 2020 , and he underwent shunt surgery on august 1st , 2020 . a medtronic strata programmable shunt in the ventricular peritoneal configuration was programmed at a level 2.0 was placed .
[doctor] good morning , mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ?
[patient] hi , doc . this is my daughter , theresa . she is the one who helps me keep things straight .
[doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hosp -- hospitalized since your shu- shunt surgery three months ago .
[patient] uh , not that i recall .
[patient_guest] no , he has n't . he has been doing much better .
[doctor] good , i'm glad to hear that .
[doctor] before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ?
[patient_guest] his walking has improved . he's now able to walk to the dining room just fine . but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him .
[doctor] that's impressive , mr . watson .
[patient] yeah , i guess .
[patient_guest] now his bladder control did improve some after surgery , but now seems to have leveled out . so he is wearing diapers .
[doctor] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper ? and any decreased or painful urination ?
[patient_guest] no , not at all .
[doctor] and how about cognition ?
[patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore .
[patient_guest] dad and i both think my sister , hannah , summarized it best . she said "" i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again , ""
[doctor] that's so wonderful ! now have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ?
[patient] no . has n't bothered me one bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain in your belly at all ?
[patient] ca n't say that i have .
[doctor] okay , sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm going to step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that all right ?
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] okay , i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month , and then we'll chat about it when i come in .
[doctor] all righty , mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . now , i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms , and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan .
[patient] so what does that mean ?
[doctor] just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another two to three months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved so that's all good for me . so really there's , there's nothing to worry about .
[patient] all right so i'll come back in three months ?
[doctor] yep , that's right .
[patient] i do have a question for you though .
[doctor] yeah , of course .
[patient] do you think i will be able to drive again ?
[doctor] ah man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point it's unlikely that your movement speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me by improving over a nine to 12 month range . and that , that definitely could be you . you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that then , ya know , i think it could be possible , um , and i'd be happy to recommend it .
[doctor] now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver safety program without my recommendation . so you could kind of do that preemptively , and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go .
[patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask . i do n't like to burden anyone when i just need to run to the store but i also know that i need to be safe .
[doctor] yeah , your safety is our number one priority and , ya know , i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right , they want to keep you here and have you safe . but , i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . and so , i'm sure when we talk again in three months , we'll continue to be on that upward trajectory or improvement .
[patient] i sure hope so , doc .
[patient_guest] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment out front ?
[doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls up front will take care of you and get you settled for three months from now , and you both take care , all right ?
[patient] thanks
[patient_guest] thank you .

[doctor] hi miss taylor , how are you today ?
[patient] hi , i'm- i'm good , thank you .
[doctor] thanks for coming in today .
[patient] yeah , no problem .
[doctor] so how have things been going for you ?
[patient] uh , they've been all right . i'm struggling with not drinking . i wanted to discuss that , uh , shot that you had mentioned last time , but we did n't get to discuss it too much .
[doctor] okay , well i'll be happy to provide you with more information . so tell me when did you last have a drink ?
[patient] on monday .
[doctor] okay , so you've gone a couple days without it ?
[patient] yeah , yeah i have .
[doctor] yeah , and had you been drinking for a while ?
[patient] yep .
[doctor] how much had- how much had you been drinking ?
[patient] um , four or five times a week hard alcohol , so , you know .
[doctor] okay . well it will certainly help your blood pressure if you're able to stop drinking .
[patient] yeah , yeah i- i- i agree with you .
[doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ?
[patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i- b- well , the first time i took it i felt lethargic and tired , so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swooshing that started in my left ear . so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know ... i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking .
[doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any , um , chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ?
[patient] yeah i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too , and no none of those symptoms .
[doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ?
[patient] mm , no .
[doctor] okay , good . are you doing the blood pressure checks at home ?
[patient] yes . yes i am .
[doctor] okay good . what kind of numbers are you seeing ?
[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening , um , where i run anywhere from like 130 to 145 or 150 over 95 to 100 on the bottom .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here it's always high but then it goes down . in the mornings it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .
[doctor] uh- .
[patient] mm , also i'm taking my medicine in the morning when i get up instead of in the evening .
[doctor] yeah , so it sounds like we are not too far out of where we wan na be .
[patient] right , mm-hmm .
[doctor] okay . well let me get a listen to your heart , go ahead and hop up here .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] use my general exam template . all right , go ahead and take some deep breaths . okay , good . any fever , cough , shortness of breath or sore throat ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] any recent travel or contact or exposure to the coronavirus ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] have you received your coronavirus vaccine ?
[patient] yes , on february 9th .
[doctor] okay , great . all right well i'm just going to look at your ankles and feet , i'm looking for any signs of swelling .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right , well everything looks good . you can go ahead and sit up miss taylor . all right , so the good news is everything is looking okay . i think we both agree if you were able to stop drinking your blood pressure would cease to be an issue for you .
[patient] yeah i agree with that .
[doctor] so let us discuss the potential medicine to help you with that . what it does is it blocks some of the brain receptors that alcohol stimulates and it tricks the brain into thinking it does not need alcohol , thereby cutting down the urges .
[patient] the urge to drink or the constant thinking about it ?
[doctor] it actually will help with both .
[patient] okay . so is it like a one-time thing ?
[doctor] generally the shot is given about once a month , it can also be given as a daily pill , but the shot does tend to work a bit better .
[patient] yeah i've taken things like this in the past and if it is a pill , i know i wo n't take it . with a shot , it's not like you can un-take it .
[doctor] yeah that's true . and the shot has been shown to work , it is more just a matter of getting you in to get your shot a month later with the nurse .
[patient] yeah , sure , sure .
[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i've said , the research on it is pretty good .
[patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .
[doctor] okay , yeah , maybe you have .
[patient] yeah , if it was available in a pill form then i'm almost certain i've tried it b- before .
[doctor] okay . if this sounds good though , we can go ahead get you started with the shot . i am looking and it looks like we have you coming back in on may 17th for your first shot , does that sound good ?
[patient] yeah , yeah , that sounds great . are there any possible side effects ?
[doctor] yeah , some people will experience some nausea , headache , dizziness , anxi- anxiety , tiredness and trouble sleeping , but generally the side effects are mild and should go away within a few days .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then we can schedule you for a follow-up in june to see how you are doing .
[patient] all right that sounds good .
[doctor] all right great . well otherwise stay with your current medicines , keep checking your blood pressure , and let's see if we can stop the alcohol for good . let us know if you have any questions or any issues come up after you receive the first dose .
[patient] all right , sounds good , thank you .
[doctor] you are welcome , have a good rest of your day .
[patient] you too .
[doctor] miss taylor is drinking alcohol four to five days per week to excess . no tobacco , no substance abuse , skin is moist , good trigger . on exam she is alert , pleasant , in no acute distress . she is not diabetic , there is no tremor , no cva tenderness , chest clear to percussion and auscultation , unlabored breathing , cardiac rhythm regular , no murmur , no gallop , jvp flat , with a head at 90 degrees . she does not appear anxious , agitated or depressed . my impression , alcohol use disorder . she would like to start naltrexone which we have previously discussed . she will take the injectable form and start on may 17th . we reviewed side effects and risks . the potential benefit of alcohol cessation would be highly beneficial to her for many reasons . hypertension , she is taking lisinopril 10 milligrams daily and hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 milligrams daily . quite possibly her blood pressure will improve completely with cessation of alcohol . her target bp is 130 to 140 over 70 to 80 . i will see her back week of june 14th , which is likely around the time of her second naltrexone injection . i recommend upgrading influenza vaccination and shingrix . number two , she did defer this .

[patient] um , about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen .
[doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection did n't help ?
[patient] it did , maybe for a couple of weeks .
[doctor] that's it ? and is it still painful ?
[patient] yeah , it's pretty painful , and now the whole leg is getting swollen .
[doctor] okay , what would you say your pain level is ?
[patient] i mean , right now it's about a 3 or so , but , typically on a normal day it's around 6 .
[doctor] okay , and its been swollen like that for how long now ?
[patient] since i was last here a couple weeks after that . so about , maybe two months now .
[doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ?
[patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time , but it has n't been helping .
[doctor] okay , okay , so that has n't been working for you ?
[patient] i mean , it helps to some degree , but it's still swollen , especially around the knee .
[doctor] hmm . has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ?
[patient] well , i slowed down a little bit , and i found a few things too fast . but when it really hurts , is when i've been sitting for a while , and then i have to try and get up . i'm so stiff getting up i have to use a cane to get my bearings . i mean , after a little bit , it loosens up , but that first getting up is real difficult .
[doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? your on xeljanz right ?
[patient] yeah , the xr , i think its , uhm , 11 milligrams a day ? yeah , but i'm taking it everyday , and i'm also taking celebrex which i started maybe 2 months ago .
[doctor] yes , the 200mgs daily . how's that working for you ?
[patient] pretty good , up until it started swelling again .
[doctor] okay , well come sit over here , and if you could take of your socks and shoes , and we'll take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit , so you'll hear me call things out and describe what i see fully .
[patient] okay , gotcha .
[doctor] right , so let's check your leg . can you straighten it , and does it hurt ?
[patient] yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way it does .
[doctor] okay , range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here , hmm , i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ?
[patient] um , just kinda sore , like an old bruise ?
[doctor] so , i can feel that the knee is hot , and that means there's something going on , like some inflammation . so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee , so we can see where all the swelling is coming from .
[patient] yeah . let's do it . sounds go to me .
[doctor] okay , and did we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ?
[patient] yeah , that was some years ago , but that was the other knee .
[doctor] okay . so i think we'll set that up for you now . we'll also do an x-ray on that knee . i can send you for a physical therapy , and if nothing is helping , then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee .
[patient] okay , sounds like a plan .
[doctor] all right , so for today we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless .
[patient] okay . and that's a procedure you're going to do right now ?
[doctor] yep . once we're done talking here , and as far as the edema in your legs , uh , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can do as well . the compression socks are a good start . um , and also , do you eat a lot of salt ?
[patient] i mean , um , i mean i love my salty snacks .
[doctor] okay . well , salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up any time you get a chance , especially at night . and have you talked to your private care doctor about this at all ?
[patient] no , i figured i would just come here first .
[doctor] okay . so i think , try some of those things out first , and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them , also , as you know , xeljanz is a high-risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months . so this time your levels are good , but do make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time .
[patient] all right . i can do that . thank you so much doc .
[doctor] yes , of course . well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee .

virtscribe_D2N145_nan,"[doctor] uh , mrn49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate .
[doctor] hi , how are you doing , jacqueline ?
[patient] i'm pretty . good . how are you ?
[doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we're , um , under good control right now .
[patient] yes . it's doing much better .
[doctor] good , good . do you have any rash leftover ?
[patient] yeah , i have a- a small bit leftover . i started using , uh , doxycycline only one a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better , to just limit it to once a day .
[doctor] okay , that sounds good .
[patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lotta improvement .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better . so it's kinda plateaued a little bit .
[doctor] i see . um , are you breastfeeding at this time ?
[patient] no , i'm not right now .
[doctor] okay , good . so you- you should not be breastfeeding while you're on that medication .
[patient] yeah , actually i stopped breastfeeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time .
[doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel .
[patient] okay . and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it i got worried . so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see .
[doctor] okay . so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses , longterm , after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that .
[patient] okay . i did n't realize that .
[doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as-needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ?
[patient] okay . then i can resume taking - taking the doxycycline twice a day again ?
[doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using ? and then we'll look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash ? uh , how frequently are you using that one ?
[patient] twice a day .
[doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ?
[patient] no , that's fine .
[doctor] okay . and you're using the metro cream ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] how often are you using that one ?
[patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream .
[doctor] okay . and then , are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ?
[patient] i'm not .
[doctor] okay . and no neutrogena wipes ?
[patient] no wipes .
[doctor] okay . um , and then what about , um , any lotions that you're using ?
[patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two .
[doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in , a lotion to just help moisturize . but we'll see .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] um , and then again , when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ?
[patient] that was last week . so the first two weeks , i did twice a day .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] and then i started seeing improvement , and then i changed to just once a day .
[doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing . you're fitzpatrick skin type iv , meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to sun tan , um , essentially , iv to v. and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day , every day , with the doxycycline .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] uh , but i would pickup the elidel too .
[patient] okay , i can do that .
[doctor] i mean , out of known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk .
[patient] it is ? okay .
[doctor] um , and doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn . um , it will make you sunburn , even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself .
[patient] yeah , i mean , i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions , with wearing a hat and all of that .
[doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that .
[patient] yes , i did . thank you .
[doctor] all right . but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it .
[patient] yeah , i did check . the insurance is not covering it .
[doctor] it's not ? okay . well , let's look around really quick because if you use a goodrx coupon , it will be around 30 to $ 40 or something .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] let's see .
[patient] so with your coupon , it was around $ 850 or something .
[doctor] ugh , yeah . that's way too much .
[patient] i agree . and- and because i also looked at the eucrisa that you recommended in my notes , and if it's still ex- if it's still expensive , i could try that instead .
[doctor] yeah , so it ... actually ... it is actually more expensive . i think the prices fluctuate .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 , and when i looked before , it was around 30 to $ 40 .
[patient] yeah . if it was around $ 200 , i would've picked it up . but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance .
[doctor] okay . so i've found the cream form . we could try ointment form .
[patient] you mean the tacrolimus ?
[doctor] yeah , mm-hmm .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so if we send it to pick'n save or metro market ... let's see where else .
[patient] can you do the metro market ?
[doctor] yeah . let me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say .
[patient] okay . but it's not a steroid , right ?
[doctor] correct , it's not a steroid .
[patient] okay , good .
[doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kinda like a steroid in that it calms inflammation .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face , for sure , as they'll make this kind of rash worse . but also , steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning of the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . um , the thing to know is that sometimes five to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle-like sensation or make it redder or flush . but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad .
[patient] okay . got it .
[doctor] so it only lasts a couple seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ?
[patient] okay , thank you for explaining .
[doctor] so i will say , "" apply to rash on face twice daily , until resolved . ""
[patient] okay . so only apply to the rash area ?
[doctor] yes , and keep using the face wash.
[patient] okay .
[doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day , just because i do n't wan na dry your sky out too much , okay ?
[patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it .
[doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't wan na create other problems for you .
[patient] all right . i'll just wash once a day with it . but it was feeling very good , like there's this little bit of moisture getting back in . with the other wash , when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out . but not with this one .
[doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day .
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] so to review , um , continue using the same face wash , continue with metro cream , and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then just do it until it's gone , and then do it for once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay , sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i'll rewrite your instructions here .
[patient] thank you so much .
[doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk . we're not gon na have you on this forever . but especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly .
[patient] sounds good .
[doctor] all right . and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible , since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone , and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write it out like that . so twice a day until rash is gone , and then once a day for another week before stopping .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] once the rash stops , you can stop the tacrolimus ointment . um , continue doxycycline another week and then stop . but you can keep using the wash and the metro cream .
[patient] okay , that sounds good . i can do that .
[doctor] and then hold off until i see you again before you start back any of your old products . um , if it's starting to flair again , um , if it's just a little bit , you can try just doing the tacrolimus for a couple days , to see if that's enough . if it's not , then restart the dy- doxycycline as well .
[patient] all right .
[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but , you know , if it does , you have the tools . um , then you'll be seeing me for a followup . we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?
[patient] yeah , sounds good .
[doctor] do you have enough refills ?
[patient] yeah , i think so .
[doctor] okay . so it looks like you have another refill of the doxycycline , so you're good there . metro cream , you probably still have enough of that one .
[patient] yes , i do .
[doctor] all right . and i'll cancel the elidel cream , just so we do n't complicate your list . uh , you have plenty of the face wash still .
[patient] yes .
[doctor] okay . uh , and we'll get rid of the clindamycin from your list as well .
[patient] and what would you suggest for a moisturizer ?
[doctor] yeah , so for that i would do something really basic like vanicream . or even , if it's just really dry , you could use a little bit of petroleum jelly . um , i'll give you a couple samples , okay ? let's make sure we have a followup in about four weeks .
[patient] okay , thank you .
[doctor] okay . and i would stay away from any kind of anti-aging thing , any kind of plant thing . um , really let's just be sure we talk about any new products , or reach out to me if you're gon na try something else . um , let's go get those samples .
[patient] okay , that sounds good .
[doctor] for assessment and plan , perioral dermatitis , rosacea , including ocular rosacea , and copy and paste her patient instructions . i recommend that she gently wash her eyelids once a day with gentle cleanser such as vanicream , also use bruder mask as needed .","S (Subjective):

aci_D2N146_nan,"[doctor] hey good morning bobby how are you

[doctor] alright well i'm i'm sorry to hear that you're having pain but i i'm glad that he sent you over to see me i wan na talk a little bit more about that pain can you describe the kind of pain that you feel
[patient] well it's it's on the right hand side of my belly it's it's right underneath my ribs and it feels like a a squeezing severe pain it comes and goes but when it comes it's really severe and i get kind of nauseated and sick in my stomach
[doctor] okay and then when you get that pain can you rate that pain for me on a scale like zero being none ten being the worst pain you've ever been in your life
[patient] when it's severe it's it's probably an eight
[doctor] okay alright and then time wise are we looking at can it just come and go anytime or is it specifically around mealtimes how how does that pain kinda wax and wane for you
[patient] most of the time it comes right after i eat
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it also can come on a couple of hours after i eat also so it's either immediately after i eat or a couple hours later but it's related to eating
[doctor] okay
[patient] you know i like to eat right
[doctor] do n't weigh all so speaking of eating let's talk a little bit about your diet i see here on your chart that you're a type two diabetic and it looked like that you were gon na handle that with diet and exercise let's talk about that a little bit
[patient] well you know i my my diet was worse when i before i was diagnosed with the the type two diabetes
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i've cut back on sugar and i started a little bit of a keto diet and i've lost about twenty five pounds over the last three months
[doctor] okay so other than the weight loss how how is your diet is that has that been working out for you i mean do you does does that does that fit your lifestyle pretty well
[patient] yeah it does it does it it i was surprised it was n't as hard as i thought to go back and cut back and go more of a keto diet
[doctor] okay
[patient] but you know trying to cut out all those carbs my symptoms got better
[doctor] yeah
[patient] with the diabetes and my my blood sugars are improving but i still get that pain underneath the ribs
[doctor] yeah and that can happen and one of those things that causes that is that those intake of that fatty foods which is you know kind of the the keystone or the hallmark of the keto diet and have you noticed any improvement when you do cut out that fatty food and has that been difficult since you are watching your carb intake
[patient] the fatty food it is a little bit difficult you know i like those pork grinds and you know i i've had to kind of cut those out they were a nice staple for me when i was on the keto diet but i have cut out the those pork rinses because those were just so delicious and you know i would say it's a little bit better but i still get that pain
[doctor] okay and then do you have any family history of gallbladder disease
[patient] yeah but you know you know i knew that was coming both my dad and my mother both had gallbladder disease and had to have their gallbladders off
[doctor] okay so both both your parents your mom and your dad had your had their gallbladders taken out
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and then i wan na talk a little bit about your activity level and your and and if you're exercising has this affected your ability to to get out and exercise
[patient] not really i mean i usually i got ta watch it around meals you know but i've never been a big exerciser right after eating anyhow but you know i'm i'm so glad springs here because it gives me that opportunity to get back out and you know i love photography i i love nature of photography and with the with the the woods going from you know that dark barron look to coming alive with that green and and butting i i love to get out and take foot photographs there
[doctor] that's awesome to hear yeah i my wife and i like to go over and take nature hikes through the new park behind the rex center that just opened up have you ever been over there to do any any picture taken we've got a bunch of beautiful nature pictures that we took about a week ago
[patient] no i have n't been there i might have to try that out yeah
[doctor] yeah it's awesome
[patient] i like to get down near the river that's where i i like to catch especially around spring time
[doctor] that's great yeah next time you come in maybe you can bring in some of your pictures that'd be awesome to see
[patient] okay cool
[doctor] so i'm just curious talking about your symptoms here have you had any fevers you mentioned something about nausea but have you actually vomited from those symptoms
[patient] there's times when the pain is really bad for a couple of days i've had some what i i would describe as low grade fevers and yes you're right i have feel nauseated but i have n't thrown up

[doctor] so i i see that you're guarded there so i'm gon na say that that it did hurt when i it did hurt when i
[patient] absolutely that hurts so much when you push right there
[doctor] okay
[patient] sorry i was just trying to capture capture my breath
[doctor] okay that's that's no problem so you are positive for murphy's signs but i do n't appreciate any peritoneal signs so let's talk a little bit about your results that i reviewed before you came in today so your abdominal ultrasound shows multiple gallstones present in the gallbladder and i do appreciate some mild thickening now the common bile duct size is within normal limits at four . one millimeters now let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you okay i do believe you have some mild cholecystitis with gallstones i do n't appreciate any frank obstruction but it looks like your gallbladder is inflamed and it looks like that's happened maybe over the last few weeks since you've been having those symptoms now since you have n't had any improvement with dietary modifications i am going to make the recommendation that we do remove your gallbladder and i would like to perform a laparoscopic cholecystectomy now what that means is i'll make a few small incisions and insert a scope with some of those instruments that's gon na remove that gallbladder through one of those little bitty incisions now the surgery is gon na take about an hour to an hour and a half and you'll probably spend the night in the hospital because we just wan na monitor you post procedure to make sure everything is okay you're still gon na wan na avoid those high fat foods after surgery and eat foods that are gon na be high in fiber now do you have any questions about what our assessment and plan is for for this

aci_D2N148_nan,"[doctor] hi jeremy how are you the medical assistant told me that you injured your back
[patient] yeah i was moving some boxes when my son was moving out of his college dorm and i really hurt my lower back
[doctor] okay how long ago did that happen
[patient] this was about four months ago
[doctor] about four months ago okay that's quite a long time and you're just seeing me now for it
[patient] yeah the appointments were backed up and i tried some pt at my gym but it it really did n't seem to help and i was really concerned
[doctor] okay and what exactly are your symptoms are you having pain when you're just sitting there or when you're moving around for a very short period of time it felt like i was gon na tapple over i like i could n't support my my upper body weight and then my right toe or the the toes on my right foot tingled a little bit but that went away after about an hour okay are you still getting that numbing and tingling periodically in your feet or is that completely gone
[patient] that's completely gone it it just happened when i first felt the the tweak in my lower back i felt that sensation but i have n't since
[doctor] okay and how about any difficulty or weakness in your legs
[patient] only if i'm carrying something heavy otherwise it seems relatively normal but i i feel the sensation so i'm a little nervous about carrying something heavy
[doctor] okay and are and do you still have pain down there in your lower back if i turn a certain way or if i roll over in my sleep i'll wake up from it from a like a sharp pain but then that that goes away if i if i position myself the right way okay and what have you been taking for the pain
[patient] i took some tylenol i took some ibuprofen i've tried heat i've tried ice and nothing really seems to help
[doctor] okay is the ibuprofen any better than the tylenol
[patient] a little bit but for sure a shorter period of time
[doctor] okay and did you get any stomach upset from the ibuprofen
[patient] no i try not to take too much so i i do n't have an upset stomach from it
[doctor] okay and did you go to like an urgent care centing or an emergency room have you had any imaging on this at all
[patient] i went to an urgent care and they wanted me to do an mri but i was a little concerned because i think we maxed out our insurance so i i did n't do it because it started to feel better but because it's been going on so long i'm i'm a little bit concerned now i i do wan na actually move forward with that
[doctor] okay alright and any other symptoms any problems with like your bladder or your bowels any incontinence or you know you feel like you ca n't go to the bathroom
[patient] no i have n't had any of those issues
[doctor] okay alright and any other any other past medical history do you that you have any
[patient] i had knee surgery about two years ago on my right knee
[doctor] okay
[patient] that went fine i rehabbed it pt has been fine it it feels about ninety five percent ever since
[doctor] okay and what did you have done to your right knee
[patient] it was a total knee replacement
[doctor] okay a total knee replacement in twenty eighteen is that what you said
[patient] no it was actually about two years ago so it's the spring of twenty twenty
[doctor] okay alright alright well i wan na go ahead and just move on to a physical exam i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] now you have you had any fever or chills with this
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright alright so looking at your vital signs here in the office you know they look really good your you you do n't have any temperature your blood pressure is good it's about one seventeen over fifty six
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] your heart rate is nice and slow at sixty eight and your oxygenation is fine at ninety five percent on room air so that means everything looks good
[patient] good
[doctor] on your neck exam i i do appreciate some bony protuberance of the c5 c6 do you have any pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay on your lumbar spine exam i do appreciate do you have pain when i touch here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so there is no pain to palpation of the lumbar spine there is decreased flexion and extension of the lower back the patient does have a positive straight leg raise and there is some spasm of the paraspinal muscles of the lumbar spine on musculoskeletal exam the lower extremities strength is equal bilaterally so what does that mean jeremy that means that you have some you know maybe a some arthritis in your neck here and or maybe just a a little bit of some injury from from that from that back that back thing that you told me about
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] okay but i think overall things look really good so you know i had them do an lumbar spine x-ray on you before i saw you and i looked at the results of your lumbar spine x-ray which showed no acute bony abnormality you know there was no fracture of your back or anything which is not surprising based on your history so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so i do believe it sounds like you have an acute disk herniation now this did happen a few months ago but it sounds like that's what you had based on the fact that you're still having symptoms
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] i do wan na go ahead and order a a lumbar spine mri to get a a a better look at what's going on you know x-rays really just look at the bones they do n't show us any of the soft tissue so let's go ahead and order the lumbar spine mri i wan na continue with physical therapy so i'm going to refer you to a a physical therapist through our health system
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i also wan na go ahead and prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] to help with that do you have any questions about that
[patient] no questions
[doctor] now if you do have a herniated disk we can go ahead and talk about some other treatment options maybe like an epidural steroid injection to help take down some of that inflammation
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] it might make you feel better but we'll we'll deal with that when we get get there okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] any questions
[patient] not at this point

aci_D2N150_nan,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam fifty milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay
[patient] okay

[doctor] i am so sorry so i mean that's really cool that you do parttery it's something that i've wanted to pick up you know but i do n't know that i have those skills yet does the pain radiate down your arm or up your shoulder or anything
[patient] yeah it does down my arm and along that inside of my arm
[doctor] okay so the medial aspect okay have you did you hit it on anything
[patient] no not that i recall
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your elbow before
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright so on a on a scale of one to ten with ten being your arm is actively being sought off by a chainsaw how bad is the pain
[patient] well i'd say it's about a seven
[doctor] wow that's pretty bad does it keep you up at night
[patient] yes it really does it's you know if i roll over and it it it just wakes me up
[doctor] okay have you done anything to relieve the pain
[patient] well i have been taking some ibuprofen but that is n't really helping
[doctor] okay and have you tried anything like ice or heat or anything else
[patient] i tried a little bit of ice at first
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but and it's just it's been hurting for about four days now
[doctor] okay
[patient] did n't getting better
[doctor] okay okay so it's probably it do you think it's getting worse
[patient] well it's just not getting better
[doctor] okay no i understand okay so i know that you also have like a history of hypertension and that we have you on ten milligrams of lisinopril have you been checking your blood pressures regularly
[patient] yeah you know what i remember too i mean they they have been pretty good one teens to one thirties
[doctor] okay alright and okay do you think that you've been good about taking your medications do you usually take them everyday
[patient] yeah pretty much i i i you know set an alarm for that lisinopril
[doctor] awesome that's great alright and so i see that you also we are treating you for diabetes as well and that we have you on five hundred milligrams of metformin twice a day how about that have you been taking that regularly
[patient] well sometimes i forget i mean having a medication twice a day you know sometimes i'm out doing stuff and i just forget to take it
[doctor] okay
[patient] and plus i kinda have a sweet tooth so you know sometimes they're a little bit higher you know like one fifty to one seventy so
[doctor] okay alright so when you say a sweet tooth what are we talking about there
[patient] i love to bak also besides my ceramics i'm really big and baking and i like to make cakes and and take them to you know parties and get togethers you know family get togethers and i like to make senna rules too i've been doing that since i was very young so i kinda noticed that
[doctor] okay cinnamon rolls can be kind of hard like do you for your cakes do you do you use fondant you know to like do any of the decorations
[patient] no i i mine are just pretty basic they're not overly fancy
[doctor] okay
[patient] simpon rolls i got that recipe out of a southern living magazine
[doctor] oof
[patient] a long time ago and
[doctor] so you know it's good
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright well so i totally understand like baking and like the excitement of being able to give those to your family but we maybe wan na start cutting down on eating and taste testing ourselves is do you think that's something we could manage
[patient] yeah i know i need to get better on it i probably could use maybe a refresher on just managing what i should and should n't eat how like if i need to combine a protein you know if i do eat something a little bit sweet maybe pling a protein or something with it
[doctor] mm-hmm yeah that sounds like a
[patient] had some friends tell me something about that
[doctor] yeah that sounds like a great idea and i think if that's something that we can maybe discuss to get you in contact with someone who can offer you someone with a degree that can offer you some really good advice you know i do n't wan na as much as it's really helpful to have friends i do wan na be able to give you like a source of truth right
[patient] yeah i i had a diabetic consult a long time ago but yeah it it would be nice to see a dietitian again and go over those and maybe there is some new stuff too
[doctor] a hundred percent yeah you know like i one of the things that i struggle with is like are eggs good for you or bad for you you know like with cholesterol i feel like it changes every other year or something like that so you're right there may be some pieces of information that we do need to update and and you know over a fresh of course would n't hurt but if you do n't mind i'm gon na go ahead and start my physical exam i'm gon na call out my findings and just go let me know if you have any questions or if anything sounds anything that you you want me to expand on further but this is just for the recording sake so we can get everything documented okay
[patient] yeah and can i ask you what word what were my vital signs can you show me what my vital signs were
[doctor] yeah that's uh uh that's a really good question so our big and favorite one is gon na be your blood pressure right so you're right like we are seeing some some definite improvement today it was one twenty over seventy and honestly that's a great place to be so that tells me that your medication is working and that maybe we can start to evaluate a bit more your respiratory rate is completely normal so i see it here as eighteen that's wonderful you are not running a fever so ninety seven . nine and you're honestly that's within like a good enough range for me you're satting pretty well your oxygen saturation is a hundred percent again so that means that you're not experiencing any kind of difficulty getting in that oxygen to the rest of your body i do wan na say that you know pain is one of the vitals that we worry about and you're saying that at it's worst your the pain in your elbow is a seven out of ten so that's something that i'm gon na evaluate and then your pulse rate seems to be appropriate as well so those are all great do you have any questions about that so far
[patient] no that sounds good yeah i was just curious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] checked it in a while so
[doctor] mm-hmm i do wan na say that like looking at your the weight we do see like maybe a five pound increase from the last time that you were here but that's completely normal right to be able like to fluctuate you know give or take five pounds so i'm not i'm not i'm not like seriously worried about it but if we do come back and notice an additional five pounds then we might have to start talking about like actually you know what let's do that right now what kind of exercise regimen are you on
[patient] well i do go for some walks in the evening i try to get one in on the morning too
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so not a whole lot other than that because i'm busy with my pottery or baking so but i do try to get out and walk daily
[doctor] okay that's awesome so like how about about how long are your walks
[patient] well i just walk around the neighborhood there is you know the sidewalks and there is kind of a little bit more of a nature type area that goes across the bridge and so it's probably you know maybe one to two miles a day
[doctor] wow that's intense i was not expecting that number that's awesome okay alright so maybe this five pounds is muscle we're gon na go for it okay but thank you but that's some really important information but i'm gon na start your physical exam now okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i know that you said that you are experiencing elbow pain could you tell me is it your left or your right elbow
[patient] it's my right
[doctor] okay alright right elbow when i touch it does it hurt on the inside
[patient] yes it does
[doctor] okay so moderate tenderness at the medial epicondyle when you turn like when you turn your wrist is if you're trying to open a door knob do you experience pain
[patient] no not really
[doctor] alright so turning out no pain but when you turn your wrist inwards do you have any pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay so pain with resisted pronation of right forearm when you rest your arm on a table with the palm side up alright i want you to raise your hand by bending the wrist do you experiencing any pain
[patient] yeah that hurts
[doctor] alright alright so when you are when i'm pressing here and like flexing your wrist are you experiencing any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright pain with flexion and when bending the wrist alright when i listen to you you know i'm just gon na check your heart and lungs everything sounds sounds good no murmur no rub no gallop your lungs are clear bilaterally to bilaterally to auscultation i'm not noticing any rash for your at your elbow i do n't notice any bruising any swelling we do wan na note that tenderness but otherwise there is no discoloration no lesions so that's good your pulses and are equal bilaterally and i think i think we have an idea of what we are dealing with here okay so i'm gon na go ahead and give you my impression and plan for your your first problem like your primary problem that you are here for is right elbow pain it's consistent with medial epicondylitis and that it just means it's pain caused from overuse and damage to the tendons in your arm what we are gon na do is rest it i'm gon na order a sling for your right arm and you can wear this while you're awake well i want you to apply ice to your elbow for twenty minutes three times a day i'm going to i'm gon na ask you to take six hundred milligrams of ibuprofen that's three pills every six hours with food and you can take that for one week i know it's really important that you said that you have something that a gift that you wan na make for your son but we're gon na hold off on pottery for the next couple of weeks just to give your arm a chance to heal you know like it's awesome that you wan na be able to do these things for your family but sometimes you know your body is not where your where your where your heart is like where your heart and your head are right and then so
[patient] i'll i'll just let him know that that i maybe i'll take a picture of what i have so far
[doctor] absolutely that's awesome and so it'll be like a a movie like coming soon to a shelf near you that's great for your second problem right we have this longstanding diabetes i want to increase your metformin to a thousand milligrams twice a day i know that you're saying you're having a hard time keeping up with that so i want you to do a good job of like checking and recording your blood sugars every day i do need you to follow up with me in a couple weeks i also wan na order something called an a1c since you are having a hard time with like the blood like the blood sugars everyday an a1c will give me a more accurate picture of like a longer period of time and then we might need to evaluate like what are what other options that we have if your sugars if we ca n't get them a bit more under control i do want you to follow up with me in a couple of weeks about the about your diabetes and for your third problem of hypertension we're just gon na continue you on your lisinopril at ten milligrams that's it seems to be doing it's job i'm really i'm really glad about that and it's probably due to the walking that you're doing i forgot to mention for your diabetes we are gon na i'm gon na recommend a a referral to diabetic counseling that way you can get like a bit more information on like the steps that you can take to help you with that
[patient] i was gon na ask you how about my x-ray the x-ray of my elbow how did that look
[doctor] your x-ray honestly looks great in that i do n't see any kind of fracture or bony abnormality so that's what makes me think that this is like a tendon related thing right so in reviewing your x-ray like it it does support the the the assessment and plan that i have given you i
[patient] okay
[doctor] do you
[patient] just true
[doctor] yeah absolutely i do think for your your primary problem the elbow that we might wan na get put you in some physical rehab if the problem is taking a little longer to heal but we'll discuss that at your next visit here okay

[doctor] okay
[patient] you know but
[doctor] well if
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah if i remember right your family do n't they own that that bakery down on the corner of main street and did n't they own that
[patient] yeah thank you

[doctor] okay
[patient] but it's been i try to contain it you know
[doctor] well let me so we're gon na have to watch that and i'll come back and we'll talk a little bit about the diabetes but let's go ahead and do that i do n't wan na do a a a quick physical exam on you i'm gon na look in your eyes here and so let me quickly look in your ears
[patient] i see
[doctor] okay that looks good and any let me let me listen to your lungs okay your lungs are clear and your heart it's a regular rate and rhythm that's all good as we go through that now i want you to sit up here i'm gon na press down your back starting at the top and any pain up top no
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and then once i get down here and around that low back i wan na press in the center first does that cause you a lot of pain
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah that that's the spot
[doctor] okay and if i come over here to the right no
[patient] not that much you know
[doctor] okay so and then on the left hand side if i push down here kind of into your butt
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] lay back on the stretcher for me for a second i'm gon na go ahead and and lift your legs for me or i'm gon na go ahead and lift your legs for you just relax i'm gon na start here on the right side when i lift that right leg up does that cause you significant pain or any pain at all

[patient] yeah yeah yeah that's that's
[doctor] yeah
[patient] still get tender yeah
[doctor] i can see that gritts on your face so okay that's good and you know as i look at your lower extremities there is no pain or numbness or tingling in your feet or anything like that
[patient] hmmm no
[doctor] okay okay so lem me talk a little bit about my impression and plan so for that low back pain i believe you have a musculoskeletal low back strain i'm going to order a low back x-ray so we'll order that and get that done as an outpatient i do n't expect to see anything significant but it's gon na tell me how those joint spaces look and if you know if we're dealing with any disk issue but that will be the start of it and i'm also gon na order some physical therapy two for two reasons to help with a little bit with the pain but also strengthen some of the muscles there in the back so those are the two things that we are gon na do now i want you to take take four hundred milligrams of ibuprofen you can take that occasionally with some tylenol when the pain gets more severe up to about three times a day i'm gon na also give you a prescription for some flexeril that's a muscle relaxant and i want you to take one of those once a day every evening but be careful if you're doing any strenuous or hazardous activities such as driving after you take those now for your diabetes my impression is that your diabetes is is under control i noticed that we do n't have n't had a a1c for almost five months so i'm also gon na order an a1c so we can find out where we are with that continue with your diet and exercise we know that's really important and then continue with your metformin i'm not gon na make any changes today but we'll go ahead and look at that once i get that results of that a1c do you have any questions for me
[patient] yeah can i still go to the bakery
[doctor] i would yes it's nice for you to go to the bakery but you ca n't have any donuts i'm no i you just really need to watch that intake of of anything that you might get at the at the bakery so just just be careful with those carbohydrates those sweets that you're taking as we go through your day it's occasional occasional one perfectly fine but on a routine basis we need to watch that
[patient] right and how soon should i you know check my blood sugars i mean what's a good you know
[doctor] yeah i that's a great question i'm really glad you asked that i would prefer that you're taking your blood pressure every morning the first thing you get up when you get up in the morning that's gon na give me a good idea and so if you can do that the first thing in the morning and keep a record of it you know i know your glucometer keeps a record of it but if you can write them down and once we get that a1c that's gon na give me a little more guidance on how to deal with your blood your diabetes
[patient] right do you think would i need to see you know a pain doctor or you know
[doctor] not yet let's let's get the that's a great question i may end up referring you to a a pain doctor for that low back pain but i really would like to start with some of the diagnostics first let's get an x-ray and if there is you know any question of that x-ray and the pain continues i'm gon na go ahead and maybe order a cat scan and then at that point in time we can refer you to a pain doctor if we're still having significant pain
[patient] sounds good

aci_D2N153_nan,"[patient] i hope i did n't hurt it again
[doctor] hi gregory how are you i the medical assistant told me that you injured your knee
[patient] yeah yeah i heard it stepping off a curb
[doctor] how long ago did that happen
[patient] about two and a half weeks ago
[doctor] two and a half weeks ago and what what knee is bothering you
[patient] the right knee the outside of my right knee
[doctor] the outside of your right knee
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay and did you actually fall down when this happened or
[patient] no i just sorta turned over my ankle
[doctor] okay
[patient] to the outside and i thought my ankle was the thing that was gon na hurt most but after the ankle soreness went away the only my knee hurt and it sort of clicks when i walk
[doctor] and no okay so now it clicks when you walk okay does it hurt when you walk
[patient] no unless i stand on one foot for an extended period of time like leaning my foot up against the wall
[doctor] okay
[patient] then i feel like it's locked and then i sort of have to ease into walking again
[doctor] okay and what have you taken for the pain
[patient] really nothing
[doctor] okay
[patient] ibuprofen but i'm not a big pill taker so i sort of sucked it up and
[doctor] does the ibuprofen work
[patient] at night you know during the day i'm more active so it it really does n't impact it because i just work through it but at night it does help me to settle down and sleep better
[doctor] does your knee hurt when you're just resting and sitting there
[patient] no when it's up it's fine when it's down on the floor with my foot flat it's fine it does hurt when i rest it on my heel
[doctor] okay and are you able to do things like bending or things like that
[patient] a full squat that's when i feel the most clicking like if i go all the way down to a full squat like a catcher that's when i feel the most clicking but otherwise no there is no pain it's just the clicking and i'm fearful that that's an injury of some type
[doctor] okay alright now you said squats are you are you active are you doing like burpees going to
[patient] no i ride the bike
[doctor] okay
[patient] i ride the bike i ride the bike which i'm not doing now peloton inside for the winter i do have a winter bike though
[doctor] okay alright well i have a peloton who is your favorite instructor
[patient] i i actually do n't have a favorite instructor i have more favorite rides
[doctor] okay what kind of rides do you like
[patient] i like rock music and regain music rides so whoever is doing those in a began or a medium content i'm cool with
[doctor] i ca n't picture you as a regade person so that's interesting to know okay alright and any numbing or tingling in your foot at all
[patient] yes but not from the knee injury i broke my foot my second toe on my right foot and i have numbness depending upon the shoe i wear
[doctor] okay when did you break your toe
[patient] i've broken it three times over the last ten years so it's just something that's a an annoyance but it was n't caused by this injury
[doctor] okay so you do have some numbing and tingling but it's not new
[patient] right correct
[doctor] alright alright well let's just go ahead and i'm gon na go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm gon na be calling out my exam findings i'll let you know what that means so on your musculoskeletal exam on your right knee i do appreciate some slight edema you do have a slight effusion does it hurt when i press on the outside of your knee
[patient] no not physically
[doctor] okay there is no pain to palpation of the right lateral knee i'm gon na be bending your knee in all sorts of positions does that hurt
[patient] only when you pull it to the outside
[doctor] okay
[patient] from my my foot when you pull it to the outside that's the only time it hurts
[doctor] okay the patient has a positive varus test there is full range of motion there is a negative lachman sign the patient does on cardiovascular exam the patient does have a palpable dorsalis pedis and posterior tibialis pulse okay well let's just i wan na talk a little bit about i had the nurse do an x-ray on you and i looked at the results of your knee x-ray and it does n't show any acute fracture or bony abnormality which is not surprising based on your injury so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you so i think you do have a a lateral a lateral collateral ligament strain based on your exam findings and this this type of injury essentially can be healed by itself you know i do n't think we're gon na need to refer you to surgery or anything like that i want you to go ahead and i'm gon na prescribe meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day i do wan na go ahead and refer you to physical therapy because if we strengthen up those muscles and areas around that injury then that will make your knee stronger it help prevent future injuries are you able to ice it at all during the day now you said you working you work in sales so you said you're home
[patient] yeah i actually i'm at home so i can ice it and i have been icing it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i mean twenty on twenty off at least four times a day
[doctor] okay and so does that help at all
[patient] it's it it makes it feel better in the morning when i first go to my desk and at the end of the day before bed you know i take ibuprofen so i do n't have swelling overnight but honestly i have a pretty decent threshold for pain so it's not good it's not changing it by much
[doctor] okay do you feel like your symptoms are getting worse or better i think i think pretty much for the last two weeks they've remained about the same the the only time i feel like they get worse is when i exert myself doing up and down like gardening in the yard or moving pots
[patient] and stuff outside that's the only time i felt like it got any worse but nothing to the point where it stayed worse
[doctor] okay alright well let's go ahead and refer you to physical therapy if you're still having pain then we might have to consider an mri
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright well it was very nice seeing you today call me if you need anything
[patient] i will
[doctor] okay bye

aci_D2N154_nan,"[doctor] hi dennis how are you today
[patient] good
[doctor] so what what brings you into the office i do n't believe i have ever seen you before here
[patient] the i'm training for a triathlon and the back of my heel hurts typically after a workout or when i first get up in the morning it will really hurt in the back of my heel all the way up into my calf
[doctor] okay now tell me a little bit about this triathlon training what do you are you are you running far are you tell me kind of how you work out for that today
[patient] i i will run about ten klometers
[doctor] okay
[patient] in the morning at lunchtime i try to get on the bike for about forty five minutes to an hour
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then in the evening i go to the aquatic center and i jump in the pool and swim for about another thirty minutes to an hour
[doctor] wow that's that's a that's an aggressive campaign to get there so really hope you get that triathlon in so you're how many days a week does this occur that you're training
[patient] i i do that five days a week on the weekends i kinda alternate between you know a long run and a long bike do n't really do a long swim but
[doctor] okay
[patient] i i just swimming on those other five days and i take one day off
[doctor] okay on your running days or when you do the running tell me a little bit about your stretching routine do you are you aggressive stretchers you do not stretch at all i know people that do both
[patient] yeah i do n't i do n't stretch at all i do n't have time for that
[doctor] okay and i'm assuming that with the bicycle either you do n't really work the lower legs to get them stretched out you just jump on and go correct
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah you know i you know when i first start off i go slow until i'm warmed up and then i
[doctor] okay tell me a little bit about the pain is you said it it's after the activity but it you when you first wake up in the morning it it's it's there also
[patient] yeah when i first get out of bed it's just it just feels really tight and almost like it's tearing and i after i been walking around for about ten or fifteen minutes it eases up a little bit but if if i ever sit down for any extended period of time and then try to get back up it's really sore again
[doctor] okay
[patient] or
[doctor] no go ahead go ahead
[patient] or after a lot of activity it'll get sore too
[doctor] okay okay i'm sure this is impacting that ability to to really focus on your training uh as you're going with that with that type of a pain so lem me go ahead and let's let's take a look at your your and your lower extremities here and yeah okay so roll up your pants yeah okay good now does your left leg hurt at all do you get that severe pain or is it mainly on the right
[patient] no it's mainly just on the right
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na just hold your leg here and i want you to take your your foot and ankle and i want you to go ahead and just pull your your toes up towards you does that create some pain when you do that
[patient] yeah a little bit
[doctor] a little bit okay now i'm just gon na hold your foot up and i want you to push against me and does that hurt
[patient] yeah that hurts a little bit too
[doctor] yeah okay okay roll over here on my my stretcher for me and i want you to dangle your your feet over the edge and what i wan na do is i just wan na i'm gon na squeeze your left calf first and when i do that does that hurt on your left side
[patient] no
[doctor] okay
[patient] no
[doctor] and i'm gon na squeeze on the right side anything there
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay well that's good your your thompson test is negative that's a really good finding and i just wan na continue pressing here on your right from your heel when i squeeze your heel does that cause significant pain at all
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah okay and if i come up a little bit further as i i run up that achilles tendon does that hurt
[patient] that's real tender
[doctor] yeah okay okay great not great so yeah go ahead and sit up for me so dennis my diagnosis is achilles tendinitis and it's really from overuse when we see this frequently when somebody starts to you know get in and train aggressively for an event i'm unfortunately i'm gon na have to ask you to stop training for a a week or two i know that's concerning but i really want this to heal before we move into that next phase i did n't ask you about medication but i'm assuming whatever you were doing was n't working significantly so what i'd like you to do is take some ibuprofen or advil that's the same medication and i want you to take three tablets every six hours and that's really an anti-inflammatory see if we can eliminate some of that tendinitis type pain that you're getting that inflammation around that achilles tendon i'm gon na also order a couple physical therapy visits and the reason for that is i'd like you to get some strength and stretching understanding i think it's important for you especially here at the beginning is to get some of that real stretching knowledge in and learn how to stretch those muscles before you start these activities and they are gon na help strengthen your your lower extremities also and i want you to come back to me within you know a week to ten days following your first couple physical therapy appointments so i can monitor how you're doing i see no reason for an x-ray at this point but if this continues we're gon na you know if you're still having pain ten days in significant pain without change modification of your activity then we may have to look at more aggressive treatment plans how does that sound for you
[patient] sounds good
[doctor] okay hey did you happen to catch that pittsburgh pang one hockey game last night
[patient] no i i was watching the track meet
[doctor] my gosh the the pang ones are on fire you know they beat up on new york seven to two i mean the hockey's just an amazing sport i i just do you guy do you do a lot of hockey down there in town here
[patient] used to when i lived in detroit
[doctor] oh
[patient] hockey town but not so much anymore
[doctor] no yeah detroit is a hockey town yeah the red wings okay well i'm gon na go ahead and i'll send my nurse in and go ahead and get you discharged and like i said i'd like to see you back here in seven to ten days after that first physical therapy appointment i've got a great phenomenal office staff you just call in once that gets scheduled they will get you in to that next available appointment so take care and i will talk to you later

aci_D2N155_nan,"[doctor] so hey christina good to see you today i see you're here you have a nonhealing foot ulcer well also looks like in my notes that you got some you've got type two diabetes and that probably the reason for your ear but ulcer not healing so how you doing today what's going on
[patient] doing pretty good except i ca n't get this ulcer to heal
[doctor] okay how long has that wound been present
[patient] maybe about a year
[doctor] a year well that that's a that's a a long time so when it started i guess did you have any trauma to the foot or did was it just all of a sudden
[patient] no trauma it just it seemed like a little blister and then i picked at it and it did get a little bit red and infected so i talked to my primary about it
[doctor] okay
[patient] i went on some antibiotics it seemed to get better but nothing is really making it go away
[doctor] okay when was the last time you were on antibiotics
[patient] it's probably been five months
[doctor] five months alright do you remember which antibiotics you were on
[patient] keflex
[doctor] keflex alright so kinda does your foot hurt or is it just just the
[patient] no pain but i do n't have much feeling in my foot
[doctor] alright so you've got neuropathy yeah that that that makes sense with the the diabetes so have you had any other symptoms like a fever chills any drainage coming from it
[patient] lately there has been a lot more drainage and i just feel a little more tired
[doctor] okay alright well that that sounds good so today is thursday so what do you have for the weekend
[patient] not too much i'll probably be walking around at the zoo on this ulcer all weekend and eating out and not doing anything my doctor wants me to do
[doctor] no yeah i yeah i know you do have that diabetes i know your pcp probably would n't be excited about you you eating out and all that but you know hopefully we can we i can at least get your your foot a little bit better so your diabetes i know we talked a little bit earlier how is that going for you is it controlled you know what's your your blood sugars running
[patient] yeah they are running better than they were but they are still in the two hundreds so my doctor does n't like that my last a1c was about ten
[doctor] okay alright yeah i i you probably definitely need to get back with your pcp about that because the a1c is is pretty high and i know he probably had you on some medication and insulin and metformin and insulin just to try to to get that lower but
[patient] yes
[doctor] you know we are here for your foot so let's let me take a look at that so we will do a quick exam of your foot so you do n't have any fever your vitals look good so on your your right foot exam i can see here you do have a one by two centimeter two inch circular wound on the dorsal aspect of the lateral right foot so it's just proximal to the fifth mtp joint i do see some yellow slough that's present with minimal granulation tissue you have no surrounding erythema or cellulitis and there is n't any evidence of fluid collection i do n't see necrosis so there is no dead tissue around it there's no odor and i i do n't appreciate any bony exposure and does it hurt when i touch it here
[patient] no
[doctor] okay so we did a x-ray of your right foot before you came in and it showed no evidence of osteomyelitis that means that there is no bone infection which is really good so let me just talk a little about my assessment and plan of your your foot so you do have that diabetic foot ulcer so what i'm gon na do is i'm going to order a abi or ankle brachial index and that's just to determine your blood supply just to see if we can actually heal that wound i know it's been there for about a year which is a pretty long time and so we just need to see if we can if you do have that blood flow just in case we need to to make other goals for that foot just to depend upon that i'm also gon na do a debridement here have you had that done before of the
[patient] yes i think so
[doctor] okay so you know you know pretty much about that so i'm just gon na try to take off some of that dead tissue we'll do that here in the office afterwards and then i'm going to prescribe you some colaganase ointment and you could just add that to your wound once a day and cover it with a sterile dressing and we're gon na try to continue that until we see it start to shrink and hopefully you know that will work between the debridement and then the ointment did they give you at your pcp they give you a surgical shoe or have you been wearing your regular shoes
[patient] i've just been wearing my regular shoes
[doctor] okay so we're gon na get you a surgical shoe and i want you to to wear that and that can help you take pressure off the area because i know you said you're gon na walk around with this zoo this this weekend so i definitely do n't want you to put much pressure on it from now on and hopefully that can help it heal and so after all that i'm just gon na see you back in two weeks and we could take another look and possible do another debridement of the ulcer so do you have any questions for me

aci_D2N156_nan,"[doctor] alright julia so you've been coming to see me for a while now ever since you had an rca stent placed back in twenty eighteen but i see you're here for follow-up after an interior stemi where we had to put in another stent right so like how are you doing
[patient] well i mean it was a real shock for me i thought everything was fine after my last heart attack and then i just started having this horrible chest pain and it would n't go away so i went to the emergency room and yeah they told me i needed another stent
[doctor] wow so you were experiencing similar symptoms similar to what you had the first time
[patient] yeah yeah it was yeah it was bad it was just like the last time
[doctor] okay have you had any chest pain or shortness of breath
[patient] no i think i saw you about six months ago and and i was doing fine
[doctor] okay have you been able to like exercise at all since since you last saw me
[patient] yeah you know i walk my dog everyday and you know we go like a mile and a half or two miles
[doctor] awesome okay yeah you know because like fall is setting in like are you excited
[patient] yeah yeah i'm excited
[doctor] do you have any like plans for the holiday
[patient] no mm-hmm no i'm just you know looking forward to seeing family and having some nice weather and yeah
[doctor] okay so i do wan na ask i know that you have a history of coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes so i wan na get an idea of like where you stand with those have you been experiencing any kind of leg swelling
[patient] i have noticed that my legs are a little swollen since they sent me home from the hospital
[doctor] okay are you able to lie flat at night when you sleep
[patient] yeah i mean i always use a couple of pillows you know i maybe i've had to sit up a little bit more but i mean for the most part i think it's pretty normal
[doctor] okay and then have you been able to afford your medications and are you taking them like your like you were prescribed
[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

aci_D2N157_nan,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixty
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else
[patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic
[doctor] yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm

aci_D2N158_nan,"[doctor] yeah so sorry so barbara is a 31 -year-old female and she has history of diabetes type two and asthma and she is here today with abdominal pain so barbara tell me a little more about your abdominal pain what's been going on
[patient] so i've been having this pain for the past one week and as you know i have a longstanding history of diabetes and i guess i've been drinking too much coffee lately i do n't know if that triggered my gastritis so
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i think it's been but lately
[doctor] okay alright and so is it increasing in severity would you say or staying about the same or what
[patient] it's gradually increasing for sure
[doctor] okay alright and along with the pain have you had any nausea or vomiting or diarrhea
[patient] nausea and vomiting is on and off
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] so i would say i've experienced nausea for about like three times in the past week
[doctor] okay okay and and so and you vomited how many times
[patient] a couple of times
[doctor] okay alright been drinking a lot of coffee you said too uh is that is that starbucks i love those nitrocolbrus and starbucks we ever had those those are incredible
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that's
[patient] and the venti
[doctor] yeah the for sure you got ta go venti on that you really have to coax them into it though they wo n't even give you it's it's like you need a license to get a venti on that that nitro it's so strong so that's my achilles heel i tell you but okay so you think that might have you think maybe coffee contributed to your abdominal pain uh you you you you've been drinking more coffee and maybe that's related as you're thinking
[patient] yeah i think so because i started last week and towards the end of last week my coffee intake was pretty bad so i've been controlling myself this week and you know i i probably just had one cup
[doctor] okay yeah okay and so is the pain in your upper abdomen or where in your abdomen is it
[patient] it's on both the sides of my upper abdomen
[doctor] hmmm okay
[patient] so i it also increases when i work out like if i wan na jog or like go for a run my abdominal pain just like spikes you know so i have to take it easy
[doctor] okay alright understood you've not had any fever with that pain have you
[patient] no i have n't
[doctor] okay alright and so how about your diabetes how's your diabetes been doing how your blood sugars been what low one hundreds two hundreds where where is it
[patient] i think it's been under control it's eight hundred so
[doctor] okay good and you're still taking the metformin five hundred milligrams once a day right no actually it looks like last visit we increased that to five hundred milligrams twice per day is that correct
[patient] yes that's probably helping me keeping it under control so
[doctor] okay good good and then for your asthma have you had any recent asthma attacks and are you still taking the flovent twice a day and albuterol as needed for wheezing
[patient] yes but sometimes i forget you know i have n't had any asthma attacks lately so i just figured i could decrease
[doctor] yep okay
[patient] i think that's a good decision though
[doctor] yeah well better to stay on the flovent daily and then just use the albuterol if you need it but if you stay on the flovent daily it will decrease the frequency of those attacks so yeah alright well let's go ahead and examine you okay so on your physical exam it's pretty normal for the most part unremarkable but i i'll i'll say on your on your heart exam you do still have a grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior exam and and i'm not worried about that we're kinda watching that but it just means i hear some heart sounds when your valves are moving and otherwise normal heart exam for your abdominal exam you do have mild tenderness in the epigastrium of your abdomen your abdomen's otherwise soft there's no tenderness in the right lower quadrant whatsoever and there is no significant tenderness in the right upper quadrant so i think you know that's right where your stomach is in the upper abdomen so i think that you know that may be you may be right this could be some gastritis so so then otherwise on your exam on your lung exam you do have some mild end expiratory wheezes very faint and otherwise normal lung exam with excellent air movement and otherwise pretty normal physical exam so let's talk about your my assessment and your plan here so first of all for the first problem of the abdominal pain i do think that you have acute gastritis and i think this is probably related to the caffeine intake and i i know that you've had a a moderately heavy history of alcohol use too so i want you to cut back on the alcohol as well you know keep that down to a dull roller like maybe keep that less than two or three drinks a week would be great and then also cut back on the caffeine and that should help and i'm going to write you a prescription for zantac as well as we need and so i'll write you a prescription you can take that twice a day that should help with the acid in your stomach and the pain and then i'm going to check a urinalysis a urine pregnancy test a cbc a comprehensive metabolic panel as well and we'll see what those results show just to be sure it's nothing else going on and then for your second problem of diabetes type two let's continue you on the metformin but i wan na adjust the dose slightly i'm gon na increase the morning dose to one thousand milligrams and the evening dose we can keep at five hundred so we'll go metformin one thousand milligrams in the morning and five hundred milligrams in the evening please continue to check your blood sugars let me know what they are when you come back you know we just keep track of those and then we'll see you back in four weeks by the way i wan na have you follow up with me in four weeks and for your third problem of asthma let's continue you on the flovent that seems to be doing pretty well continue to take that daily and then also albuterol as needed so how does that sound for a plan any other questions comments suggestions
[patient] that sounds good and i also feel like i'm eating been eating a lot of spicy food

aci_D2N159_nan,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your mouth okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much

aci_D2N164_nan,"[doctor] so elizabeth is a 53 -year-old female today complaining of chest pain and she has a past medical history of diabetes and high blood pressure so elizabeth tell me what's going on with your with your chest pain
[patient] i do n't know every time i start walking i'm just having this kind of pressure and chest pain in my chest
[doctor] okay are you having it now or is it gone right now
[patient] right now it's not there
[doctor] okay and how long have you been having this
[patient] probably maybe three months
[doctor] okay and what seemed to bring it on anything exacerbated or relieve it
[patient] it mainly happens when i'm walking i like to try and walk but lately i just have n't been able to keep up with it because i'm having this pain
[doctor] alright and well how would you describe this pain it's like a dull pain sharp pain stabbing pain how would you describe it
[patient] i would say it's dull it's kinda like a pressure
[doctor] okay and does it go anywhere or radiate any place
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright but no chest pain right now no shortness of breath no sweats or clamminess or anything like that right now
[patient] nothing right now
[doctor] okay alright well certainly you know i looked at your ekg that did we did in the office when you came in the ekg i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so i'm you know we should definitely talk about the plan for this chest pain in a few minutes but right now the good news is i do n't see any signs of a heart attack or anything like that so let's talk a little bit about your other conditions since you are here today how are you doing with your diabetes i know we have you on metformin and we talked about last time about you know improving your diet and exercise i'm glad you're exercising but i'm so sorry to hear about the chest pain so tell me about how is that going
[patient] yeah i mean i think my blood sugars have been a little higher because i have n't been able to be active and i'm trying with the diet you know i do love sodas so i'm really trying strength dose
[doctor] yeah i i am addicted to diet coke myself so i i hear you on that one and we had checked your hemoglobin a1c last time it was you know seven . which is pretty good it's not you know it could be better but it's not it's not bad and we talked about sending you to ophthalmology also for an eye exam have you seen ophthalmology in the last few months or last before i saw you
[patient] i have an appointment in two weeks it was a long waiting
[doctor] okay got it and any nausea vomiting or diarrhea or anything like that with your diabetes or any side effects from your medications the metformin
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright good and i saw also there was a record in your i was looking at your record before previously before i walked in you also had we've been checking your blood pressure but but i think you've been into several other clinicians and they had documented high blood pressure have you noticed any findings with that or have you know have anybody talked about high blood pressure with you or mentioned that because we do n't have it in our system here yet but i did add it in today but we do n't have you on any medications yet for that
[patient] no i mean i do n't know doc no one told me about high blood pressure do i have high blood pressure
[doctor] well i think the last time you were in the clinic and one of the clinics said the referrals the your blood pressure was elevated so they had mentioned that i noticed a trend in your blood pressure it's been running on a little bit on the high side we have n't really diagnosed you with that yet but i think we are something that we should definitely consider looking at your trend of your blood pressure readings over the last you know a few years
[patient] okay do you think that could be causing me my my chest pain
[doctor] it certainly could be contributing to that it certainly could be a factor that we need to look at so
[patient] someone had told me before
[doctor] yeah me too but we we can we can definitely you know get you started on some monitoring devices for that and also maybe start you on some some diet control things that we can do to help with the blood pressure and maybe start you on some blood pressure medications if we need to okay
[patient] okay sounds good
[doctor] so let me examine you elizabeth for a second for the because we're running out of time here for a second so i'm gon na go ahead and do my exam we got ta just did my magical exam and i'm gon na go ahead and verbalize some of my findings just so i can get it documented in my note okay and i'll explain things as we go along so there is no jvd there is no swelling in your neck there's no carotid bruits your lung exam is clear i do n't hear any crackles or rhonchi your heart exam you do have a two over six systolic ejection murmur you had that in the past otherwise it's regular rate and rhythm your pulses are equal your belly exam is nice and soft your no tenderness no guarding no masses that i can feel on your belly and your back exam is fine your extremity exam you have a little bit of swelling in your lower legs one plus nonpitting edema or swelling in the in your in your ankle area here no calf tenderness so what does all this mean i'll explain that in a second so basically your exam is pretty normal except for you have a little bit of swelling in your legs so you know with this chest pain i'm a little bit so the first diagnosis that we talk about is this chest pain i'm worried about my suspicion is you have something called unstable angina especially considering your history of diabetes and the suspected history of high blood pressure and your family history of of heart disease in the past as well i'm i'm gon na go ahead and refer you to cardiology i reviewed your ekg today so that looks normal so that's good no other signs of a heart attack but i am worried that you may have some sort of a blockage going on that's causing this chest pain i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some aspirin daily i'm also gon na give you a prescription just a baby aspirin you can take eighty one milligrams once a day and also i'm gon na give you a prescription for nitroglycerin it's a it's a little pill you split underneath your tongue if you have this chest pain if it does n't go away after one or two pills i want you to go to the hospital call nine one one and go to the hospital but we will try to get you into cardiology the next week and get you set up for some sort of a stress test to look at your heart okay any questions about that
[patient] so anytime i have a chest pain even if i'm just like walking i have to take that pill
[doctor] yeah if you if you stop walking the chest pain goes away you do n't have to take the pill but if you are walking or you stop and the chest pain does not go away i would take the pill and see if it goes away if it does not
[patient] how long like how long do i wait to see if it goes away
[doctor] about five minutes so you can take it up to three pills every five minutes and if it does n't go away then i would you know go to the hospital and get this checked out because i worry about with this chest pain that you're having making sure it does n't lead to a heart attack those chest pain could be a you know a a a sign that you may be having some less blood flow to your heart and we need to get that checked out pretty quickly
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] and for the second problem the diabetes you know i think you're doing fairly well continue with your eye ophthalmology appointment you have for your eye exam for the diabetic retinopathy continue the metformin five hundred milligrams twice a day i'm gon na order another hemoglobin a1c today and i'm gon na have you come back in about two weeks and we can see if we need to make any adjustments continue to try to stay away from you know the the pop and the sweet things and once we have your heart taken care of or make sure your heart is okay you can and we can hopefully resolve this chest pain that you're having get back to your exercise regimen okay any questions about that
[patient] no
[doctor] okay and for the third diagnosis the high blood pressure you you do have a trend i've noticed in your chart that your blood pressure's been running a little bit high several other people have documented as well i'm gon na go ahead and start you on some hydrochlorothiazide it's a pretty low dose medication to help you with your blood pressure plus it'll also help with you some of the swelling you have in your in your feet i'm gon na have you use a blood pressure cuff at home and enter your findings at epic mychart and i'll get a reading of those as well and then what when you come back in two weeks we'll keep a log of your blood pressure daily in the morning when you wake up and see how things are going and then if we need to make any adjustments to the medications we can but especially considering your history and the chest pain and the diabetes and the swelling i think starting this hydrochlorothiazide is a probably a good idea
[patient] okay are there any side effects with this medication
[doctor] yeah it can cause sometimes it can cause a little bit of make you go to the bathroom a little bit more often in the evening but generally most people do n't have a whole lot of side effects i'll give you a handout of the side effects but sometimes you can have a cross reaction with some other medications like sulfa medications but generally most people tolerate this pretty well
[patient] okay

[doctor] alright well can can you describe the pain for me
[patient] yeah so it's it's like a deep achy pain that it i feel like it's behind my kneecaps and sometimes i can even hear like what seems like like some creaking in my knees
[doctor] hmmm alright now tell me what what type of activities makes that pain worse
[patient] so i feel like the pain gets worse anytime i'm like getting from like a seated position to standing so i i work from home so i'm at my desk a lot so anytime i get up i have some pain or after watching tv or even like going up and down stairs it's really painful
[doctor] hmmm okay and does anything make the pain feel better
[patient] usually after i rest it for some time it does help with the pain
[doctor] okay now you did mention earlier that you have tried some things in the past can you tell me what they were
[patient] yeah so when it first started hurting i was putting ice on it and i even got like some ace bandage like wrapping from the pharmacy i do take ibuprofen or aleve sometimes but i try to avoid really taking any medications
[doctor] okay and and tell me what is your day like
[patient] well i try to be as active as i can i actually love to run and i would run like five to six miles a day but now i i mean honestly i ca n't even get to half a mile and my leg will start hurting my knee will start hurting
[doctor] okay that's definitely a decrease in your mileage there where have you been running lately like do you run outside or on a treadmill or
[patient] yeah i i you know i will do the treadmill during the winter but i just love being outdoors and running
[doctor] yeah yeah there are some really nice senior routes here in boston is n't there like
[patient] there are
[doctor] so many knee places there's some right by the harbor that i've i've done some runs there before too it's pretty nice well i mean the boston marathon what can you say right
[patient] right exactly exactly no it's very nice
[doctor] well okay well hopefully that we get you feeling better so you can start running again more than . five miles but tell me though have you noticed any swelling or redness in your knees
[patient] no not really
[doctor] okay and have you ever injured your knees before
[patient] no i've been pretty good i actually have never broken a bone actually no i'm gon na change that actually i did break my arm when i was in sixth grade but nothing since then
[doctor] okay
[patient] i
[doctor] okay and it's just your arm right not not your knee
[patient] right
[doctor] okay well alright well let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you here let me look at your vital signs okay i reviewed your vitals they they overall they look good take a listen to your heart real quick alright and your heart exam i hear regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs and on your musculoskeletal exam i have seen you and walk around here and you do have normal gait alright now i'm gon na have you do some movements on your legs here okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright good your strength is three out of five for abduction of legs bilaterally and the remainder of muscle strength for your lower extremities are five out of five so that's good let me take a look at your knee now on your knee exam there is no overlying erythema that's redness or ecchymosis and that's bruising or any warmth of the skin appreciated there is no effusion let me go ahead and feel around here does that hurt right here how does that feel
[patient] it does
[doctor] sorry so there is tenderness to palpation of the bilateral retinacular retinaculum and there is positive patellar grind test alright and can you are you able to squat for me
[patient] i can but that hurts
[doctor] okay alright so you're definitely having some knee pain with squatting and i'm just gon na maneuver your leg just a little bit here real quick okay so lachman anterior and posterior drawer and mcmurray tests are all negative bilaterally so that's good there okay now your neuro exam patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical alright so now i did review the results of your x-ray and both of your knees which shows no fractures or osteoarthritis so let me go ahead and tell you about my assessment and plan so for your problem of bilateral knee pain based on what you told me your exam and reviewing your mri your symptoms are consistent with patellofemoral pain syndrome and this is a very common condition that we see that causes knee pain especially in active young people so this condition has to do with the way your kneecap which is your patella how that moves along the groove of your thigh your thigh bone which is the femur now for the pain you may continue taking ibuprofen or anti-inflammatory as needed to help with the pain but i'm also going to recommend physical therapy where where they will show you a number of lower extremity exercises and this will help increase your lower extremity strength your mobility and correct any incorrect running mechanics that you may have so do you have any questions for me about that
[patient] will i be able to run anytime soon
[doctor] well that is a goal of treatment and to get you back in running again now you will have to take an take it easy from running for now but we will continue to assess your progress with each visit okay
[patient] okay

aci_D2N167_nan,"[doctor] angela good to see you today so i'm writing here in my notes that you're you're coming in you had some left knee pain so how did you hurt your knee
[patient] yeah so i hurt my knee the other day when i was running around with my niece she she is learning how to take off the training wheels for her bike
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i fell and i think i twisted my knee in some kind of funky way
[doctor] okay that that that that's not good how old are your niece
[patient] she is five and perfect
[doctor] well that's good that you're trying to help her with the learning how to ride a bike
[patient] yeah
[doctor] that sounds fun but i'm i'm sad as you hurt your knee doing it so for your knee pain are you are you able to bear weight on that leg the left leg
[patient] well i've been limping ever since and it really has n't gotten better so i thought it was maybe time to come see you because it happened about a week ago
[doctor] yeah yeah it's a definitely a good time to come see me so what part of your knee would you say it hurts
[patient] honestly it's been hurting on both sides more so on the inside than the the outside
[doctor] so okay so more in the medial aspect less on the lateral okay that makes sense and you said did you hear a pop when you when you twisted it
[patient] yeah i did
[doctor] okay alright so how would you rate your pain with your knee out of out of one to ten
[patient] it started off as like a four but i think it's getting worse and it's starting like it's it's like a like a throbbing kind of pain yeah
[doctor] alright and have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah so i i had like a ulcer not too long ago so my doctor told me that i could n't take any like kind of advil or ibuprofen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so i've been taking some tylenol and i wrapped it with kinesiology tape are you familiar with that
[doctor] yep yeah i'm i'm familiar
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright and has the has the ibuprofen been helping you at all
[patient] i ca n't take ibuprofen
[doctor] i mean i'm sorry the tylenol
[patient] no it's okay but the tylenol it helps like a little bit but you know like it's it's got like a time limit right so by the time and i'm not supposed to take it like more than like every like four hours or something like that but by hour or two like it it hurts again
[doctor] okay yeah that yeah you ca n't take too much of that tylenol because it'll it'll mess up your liver definitely
[patient] right
[doctor] alright so go ahead and do a quick exam on your knee here so when i press here does that hurt
[patient] yeah like when you press on the inside that hurts a lot
[doctor] okay alright i'm gon na do a couple of other other maneuvers here for your knee so on your left knee exam i do appreciate some edema you also have some effusion some fluid in the knee you have moderate range of motion so you're able to move it a little bit but not all the way i also see you have some pain on flexion and extension of the knee even negative lachman's test and a negative valgus and varus test as well so all that to say is i do n't think anything is is torn in your knee based on the your physical exam so we did do a x-ray of your left knee and luckily it was normal so there is no fractures no bony abnormalities so everything is good there so let me talk to you little bit about my assessment and plan for your knee okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] alright so for your your left knee pain i believe you you have a mcl strain or a medial collateral ligament that's the inside of your knee i think when you were running with your knee she had somehow twisted it and so you strained that ligament there so for that what i want to do i'm going to give you some pain medication that's not an nsaid so i will put you on some tramadol you can take fifty milligrams you can do that twice a day and then you can take that tylenol as needed for breakthrough pain alright i'm gon na put you in a knee immobilizer leg knee immobilizer and you can wear that for the next week i just wan na keep the knee from moving so it can heal a little bit and reduce some of the inflammation that you're seeing here and i also want you to ice it and you can do that three or four times a day for twenty thirty minutes at a time and that should help some of that swelling as well and i i you know i know your niece is gon na be upset but i just do n't want you to be running probably for the next three weeks with her just to help us get time to let allow the knee to heal so how does that sound
[patient] that's alright how long do you think it'll be before i can like run or something like that
[doctor] hmmm i think you'll be back to normal in about a month the strain does n't seem too bad but we just need to get you off of the knee so we can allow it to heal i mean once we do that you know along with you know the icing the mobilization and you taking the medication i think you'll be good to go in a month if you do feel like you're getting a little bit worse please feel free to call the office and we can get you in and possibly do more imaging such as an mri to you know to see if it's anything worse but i do n't think it is but just let us know how you feel in a couple of days

[patient] yeah .
[doctor] . when you're traveling ?

[doctor] okay , all right . and are you taking your medication , are you taking the lisinopril ?

[doctor] okay , all right . um , so i think we had started you at a , kind of , a moderate dose , so we'll have to talk about that a little bit , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] then in terms of your depression , how are you doing ? i know that we did n't start you on medication , since you're on a bunch of other medications . what- what are your strategies for dealing with that and how are you doing ?
[patient] so last year i started therapy and i've been going once a week and that's really helped .
[doctor] okay , all right , great . and how is your support system ?
[patient] really great . my boyfriend , my mom , and my brother are- are s- , amazing and they're all super close to me , so it's been , it's been good .

[patient] uh , i have a little bit of nasal congestion , but that's just from my seasonal allergies .
[doctor] okay , all right . well i want to go ahead and do a quick physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the blood pressure .

[doctor] hey , dragon , show me the echocardiogram .
[doctor] and this is just the echocardiogram from just a few months ago that just , you know , show that you have that slightly leaky heart valve , nothing to do for it , and that the heart murmur is stable , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so let's just talk a little bit about , you know , my assessment and my plan for you . so , for your first problem , your high blood pressure , it's not controlled at this time , so i want to go ahead and increase the lisinopril to 40 milligrams once a day . i want you to continue to check your blood pressures and report them to me through the patient portal and we'll have to make adjustments if necessary and maybe have to add a second agent , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then for your second problem , uh , i want , you know , for your depression , i do n't think that we need to start you on any medication , it sounds like you're doing really well from that standpoint , but you know that you can contact me if you , if you need anything , okay ?

[doctor] so evelyn is a 56-year-old female with a past medical history significant for coronary artery disease , prior carpal tunnel release , and a herniated disc who presents for her annual exam . so evelyn it's been a little while since i've seen you , how have you been doing over the last year ?
[patient] i've been doing okay , um , everything , um , with my herniated disc in my back has been doing really well . i have n't had any , um , back pain , or any , um , limitations in movement , so that's been doing well .
[doctor] okay , yeah , i know that we have done a steroid injection for that , uh , a couple of month- , uh , several months ago , so that's- that's doing well ?
[patient] yeah , it is .
[doctor] okay , i'm glad to hear that . and then , how about your carpal tunnel issues , you had that fixed a couple of years ago , so are you having any recurrent issues , or you good , you back to work ?
[patient] i am back to work . i have n't had any issues , and i've had full range of motion , and it's- it feels really good .
[doctor] all right , so no numbing and tingling in your hands ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay , that's good . and then , you know , i know that you've had , uh , prior stenting in the past for your- for your heart , and your heart vessels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] how are you doing from that standpoint ? have you had any chest pain , shortness of breath , nausea or vomiting ?
[patient] over the last month i've been having a bit of chest pain , but i have n't had any of the other symptoms you mentioned .
[doctor] okay , does the chest pain happen when you walk ?
[patient] yeah , it does .
[doctor] okay , and does it- does it go away if you- if you rest ?
[patient] yeah , it does actually .
[doctor] okay , all right . do you ever get it just sitting there at rest ?
[patient] no i do n't .
[doctor] okay , all right . okay , and- and can you describe it ?
[patient] it's like a burn .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] it it just feels like it's burning , um , nothing terribly concerning , not enough to send me to the er , but i do notice it .
[doctor] okay , and where exactly is it located in your chest ?
[patient] just , um , right in the middle ...
[doctor] okay .
[patient] right here .
[doctor] okay . and how often are you getting it ?
[patient] um , probably about three- three times a week .
[doctor] okay , all right . well i'm glad that you talked about that with me today , um , i know the nurse did a review of systems sheet with you , and , you know , you're obviously endorsing this- this chest pressure . um , have you had any other symptoms , i know the- the other ones that you have n't had , but any lower extremity edema , or muscle aches , or fever chills ?
[patient] no , nothing like that , but i have had a little bit of congestion , um , just from allergies , because of the pollen .
[doctor] okay , so you're endorsing some nasal congestion ?
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right , well let's go ahead and we'll do a physical exam , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon ? show me the vital signs . so here your vital signs look really good , i'm- i'm happy to see that your blood pressure is under- under good control , and your oxygenation is fine , so i'm just gon na take a listen to your heart and lungs , and i'll let you know if i find anything , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay , so in physical exam your heart has a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur , which we've heard before . your lungs are nice and clear , uh , i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits , and- and you have no lower extremity edema , you have healed , uh , surgical scars on your- on your , uh , right wrist . um , so let's go ahead , i wan na look at some of your results , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , show me the echocardiogram ? so this is the echocardiogram from last year , you know , you did have a slightly low pumping function of your heart at 45 % , but , uh , i- , you know , i suspected that will improve over time , and you did have some slight , what we call , mitral regurgitation , that's just a leaky heart valve , and that's that murmur that i heard . hey dragon , show me the ecg ? and here , you know , in reviewing your results of your e- ecg , you know , it looks stable , it just kinda reflects your prior coronary artery disease . there's no new changes , which is good , so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you .
[doctor] so , from your first problem , you know , your carpal tunnel release , i do n't think that we need to anything further about that , 'cause you seem to be doing really well , you're back at work , if you have any recurring symptoms , just let me know , and we can take it from there . for your next problem , your herniated disc , that also sounds like your doing really well , i do n't think that we need to refer you for any further steroid injection , or physical therapy at this time . so , if you have recurrent symptoms , i want you to let me know . and finally , your last problem , the most concerning problem to me is your known coronary artery disease , and this recurrent chest pain you have .
[doctor] so , i wan na go ahead and continue you on your asprin , and your toprol , okay ? i wan na go ahead and order a stress test for you to see if you have more blockages that could be causing this chest discomfort , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i'm gon na go ahead and get a lipid panel and , uh , start you on crestor 20 mg , once a day , okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] hey dragon , order a cardiac stress test . do you have any questions ?
[patient] no , that's it .
[doctor] okay , all right . hey dragon , finalize the note . so , it was good to see you , the nurse will come in , she'll help you get your scheduled for all of those things , and i'll be in touch , okay ?
[patient] okay .

[patient] my girl that i talk to and stuff , she uses on her feet ; she really likes it . it's , like , a foot scrub or some type of cream . i put it on when i think of it after the shower . so i could get my own instead .
[doctor] that sounds good . so for now , your sugars , we're gon na check your ... we're going to recheck your blood work today , but the sugars last time we checked , the a1c , your blood sugar average was above nine . i really want you to increase the glimepiride . so the ones you have at home , the two milligram , take two of them twice a day .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] okay . watch for low sugars , weak , shaky , sweaty . if that happens , let us know , and i do n't expect it to .

virtscribe_D2N179_nan,"[doctor] patient mrn : abc123 . date of birth : january 1st , 1960 . patient is a 60 year old , right-handed male , referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling .
[doctor] hello , mr. cook . how are you doing this morning ?
[patient] hi , dr. martinez . this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now .
[doctor] so it's in both of your hands ?
[patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them ... well , once they healed , i mean , i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness .
[doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ?
[patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes . the right is just worse , but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month . when i broke them , my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some s- mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident , and they told me it was a contusion .
[doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ?
[patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here . on the other side , it's from here to here .
[doctor] i see . so on the right side , you're pointing from the middle and ring finger , all the way up the forearm . and on the left , the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger . and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ?
[patient] eh , it's mainly just sore . sometimes they throb , but overall , they feel weaker too , especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull .
[doctor] and when do you feel these symptoms ?
[patient] well , really , i guess , just more so at night , and they come and go throughout the day .
[doctor] okay . and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ?
[patient] like , feeling something ? no , not that i can really think of . though , in general , they may be less sensitive than they should be , but i can still feel . they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should .
[doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ?
[patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet .
[doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] all right , thank you , mr. cook . okay , first , we'll go over your review of systems . correct me if i'm wrong in any of this .
[doctor] constitutional , you have fatigue and weight gain ; gi , you have excessive appetite and bloating ; eyes have floaters ; cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling ; endocrine , you're always hungry ; skin , you have some nail bed changes , dryness , itching ; musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain . and the remainder of the review of systems is negative .
[patient] yep , that's all correct .
[doctor] all right , we're going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ?
[patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers .
[doctor] sensation is normal , except pin prick sensation diminished in third and fourth fingers on the right .
[doctor] and how about on the left ?
[patient] um , yeah , but these two a little less .
[doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left
[doctor] okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric ; 2+ knees ; toes are downgoing bilaterally .
[doctor] all right , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ?
[patient] yeah , it feels like a zing up my wrist and something into my elbow too .
[doctor] and how about the left side ?
[patient] yeah , same on that side too .
[doctor] tinel sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal .
[doctor] all right , so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or , potentially , this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests car- bilateral carpal syndrome , as the nerve in your wrists are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me .
[patient] okay , so how do we make it better ?
[doctor] first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we'll need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you are having your issues .
[patient] that sounds fine to me .
[doctor] great . after the tests are complete , you can return here for a follow-up visit . if you're still having symptoms , we can consider a referral to our hand clinic , possibly for injections or carpal tunnel release se- surgery . you could also refer ... we could also refer you to an orthopedist for the same treatment .
[patient] sounds good , doc .
[doctor] all right , keep wearing your splints , and i will see you after those studies .

virtscribe_D2N181_nan,"[doctor] michelle king , date of birth 01/05/1986 , mrnq27631 . new patient visit for acid reflux . past medical history of anxiety and seasonal allergies .
[doctor] hello , are you mrs. king ?
[patient] i am .
[doctor] i'm dr. phillips . very nice to meet you .
[patient] you as well .
[doctor] how can i help you today ?
[patient] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i've just got really bad acid reflux .
[doctor] okay . can you tell me more about it ?
[patient] yeah . though i mean i ... right now , i take 40 milligrams of omeprazole twice a day . some days , it is fine , but others are just really bad .
[doctor] what do you feel ?
[patient] it feels like burning .
[doctor] in your chest ?
[patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat .
[doctor] in your throat and chest . all right . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ?
[patient] no , not really .
[doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ?
[patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years .
[doctor] okay . and how long have you been on the omeprazole ?
[patient] on the way , it is now i think about a year .
[doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ?
[patient] i mean , i can tell it's helped because some days , i'll be fine , and then some days , i eat something and it feels terrible .
[doctor] are there any things that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint , like food choices or stress ?
[patient] sure . probably stress and food choices sometimes .
[doctor] okay . what things bother you ?
[patient] spicy foods , um , so i try not to eat them too often , but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it .
[doctor] we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that , even sodas . um , even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato-based products or citrus products ?
[patient] yeah , sometimes , but i still eat them .
[doctor] okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing , though . how's your weight been ? pretty stable ?
[patient] i'd say pretty stable , although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past two months . i have been under a lot of work stress .
[doctor] what do you do for work ?
[patient] i'm a paralegal .
[doctor] okay . and any family history of gi issues ?
[patient] um , my grandmother had esophageal cancer .
[doctor] on your mom or dad's side ?
[patient] mom's side . and my mom had some issues like acid reflux , and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach .
[doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ?
[patient] i think maybe when i was younger .
[doctor] but not in the last 10 years ?
[patient] no .
[doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ?
[patient] um , at one point i was on omeprazole and ranititine -dine . it did help . but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken .
[doctor] okay . have a seat here , and let me listen to your heart and lungs , and then we can talk about a plan for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so normal physical exam per my new patient template , except for well-healed abdominal surgical scars noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ?
[patient] i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around one month old .
[doctor] hm , gotcha . okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several-year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole , 40 milligrams twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ?
[patient] yes .
[doctor] and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated bev- beverages , citrus , and tomato-based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd , even though you're taking the ppi .
[patient] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods .
[doctor] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms .
[patient] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me .
[doctor] so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally , we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium .
[patient] that's fine with me . i'm definitely open to trying whatever .
[doctor] perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 milligrams twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i'll also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd , or upper endoscopy , to look for potential causes of the gerd . we'd sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth , down your throat , through your stomach , and end in the small intestines . we'd look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything .
[patient] okay . can i schedule that today ?
[doctor] yeah . you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary , stress , and medication changes . how does all of that sound ?
[patient] that sounds good .
[doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the checkout desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment .
[doctor] please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms pers- persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph-impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_D2N182_nan,"[doctor] . next patient is michelle king . date of birth : 05/07/1982 . please use toc template . she was admitted to district regional hospital on 06/29/2021 , and was discharged on 07/02/2021 . the patient is a 39-year-old female with history of quadriplegia due to , uh , prior spinal cord injury . she was experiencing increasing concerns for spasms and lightheadedness , significant constipation , and reported diaphoresis . she was evaluated in the emergency department where she was , uh , febrile and had significantly elevated white blood cell count of 23,000 . there were concerns for ongoing urinary tract infection , but she was treated with iv antibiotic therapy . she had labile blood pressure , headache , and vomiting . in the end , she slowly improved . she does have a supra-pubic catheter . cultures were obtained and reviewed . she was eventually discharged after clinical improvement of her symptoms . she presents today to follow up regarding these concerns . hi , michelle . how are you doing ?
[patient] not too bad . and yourself ?
[doctor] i'm good , thanks . so , it looks like you had an infection , right ?
[patient] yeah . but you know , i really do n't think it was a uti .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i told them when i went to the er ... is that your phone ?
[doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to you and me and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . um , tell me what's going on .
[patient] it is , in my humble opinion , that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high . and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted , and they did x-rays and everything , but they said , "" no , "" as they did n't think that was n't ... that was it . but you know , i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped .
[doctor] okay . um , and the white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high .
[patient] so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count ?
[doctor] typically , it does n't .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] but , i mean , when i looked at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive .
[patient] yeah , that's what they said .
[doctor] and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit , and last year it was normal , so ...
[patient] hm .
[doctor] but in saying that , you know , inflammation can do that . so , yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] uh , they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray . but you feel like you're back to your normal self now ?
[patient] yeah . i mean , i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control .
[doctor] mm-hmm .
[patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up . and i know , at that point , i'm at the loss of what i can do at home .
[doctor] yeah , it was good that you went in .
[patient] so i went in and they made me feel better , and then i went home , as you know .
[doctor] well , maybe that's all it was .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ?
[patient] yes , i am .
[doctor] good . let me take a quick listen to you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] all right . go ahead and take a few deep breaths . and breathe normally . now take several deep breaths . and two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ?
[patient] nope .
[doctor] great . so here are my thoughts .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] you may recall it was extremely hot during that period leading up to you going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part ?
[patient] yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it ? and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot .
[doctor] okay . well , if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit it can lead to further , um , or worsening constipation issues .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff , and i blame that a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last two weeks of june . so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then , if you could , come back in and we could do some , uh , complete blood work , uh , including your white blood cells and a full panel of cholesterol , since it's been a while .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now . um , but maybe if i put some labs in you could come in in two to three weeks ?
[patient] sure , i can do that .
[doctor] great . so that appointment will let us kill a bird ... two birds with one stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and then , i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay , because if it remains elevated then that means there's something else going on with your bowels .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i do n't think that's what we'll find , but we'll see .
[patient] i mean , i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while , even though i drink the miralax every day .
[doctor] yeah .
[patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that .
[doctor] have i ever given you lactulose ? it would be a medicine you use in , um , conjunction with miralax . sort of a rescue type thing .
[patient] is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ?
[doctor] yes .
[patient] then , yes . i have it . it takes about two days to work and then it's a brutal two days .
[doctor] got it . yeah , it can be a little rough , but it works .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] all right . so we have our plan . any questions ?
[patient] yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid , if we can .
[doctor] sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ?
[patient] i am unvaccinated .
[doctor] so what are your concerns about the vaccine ?
[patient] well , we do n't know the side effects .
[doctor] correct , we do n't .
[patient] it's too soon to tell the side effects , and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as "" vaccine injury "" .
[doctor] right .
[patient] which i had never heard of before . i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to beat it , even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c.
[doctor] okay .
[patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored . so i guess i do n't feel as though i really the vaccine .
[doctor] well , my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid it's not going to be good for you .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] and i think it's safe . i mean , i understand and hear you . all of these stories out there about this , uh , regarding the vaccine . but i've seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice , and i do n't disagree that if you got covid you'd probably be okay .
[patient] yeah .
[doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i have had healthy people die from covid .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] i've had some people get really , really sick from it . so personally , i believe that this vaccine is completely safe . i really think that .
[patient] all of them ?
[doctor] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines , so you have to go back and think about it . do you get flu shot every year ?
[patient] no , i do n't .
[doctor] right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making a consistent viewpoint .
[patient] well , i am open-minded to this .
[doctor] mm-hmm . to me , it's , you know , a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we've seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything . um , and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country .
[patient] mm-hmm .
[doctor] the er is full of these vaccines .
[patient] i understand .
[doctor] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine . i mean , there's guillain-barre , and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . my thing for you is i'm not convinced that there's alternative stuff or even the treatment we have , like the monoclonal antibodies , that will give help , but it's just my opinion .
[patient] well , that's what i'm here for .
[doctor] yeah . right now the numbers are low . even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly .
[patient] okay .
[doctor] so that's what's gon na happen with covid . that's what's mo- most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end , is that the virus starts losing its potency .
[patient] sure .
[doctor] but think about it , and if you have any more questions you can certainly let me know , okay ?
[patient] will do .
[doctor] all right . anything else we can discuss today ?
[patient] nope . i think i'm all set . thank you .
[doctor] you're welcome . so we'll see you in two to three weeks . have a good rest of your day .
[patient] thanks , you too .

virtscribe_D2N185_nan,"[doctor] okay . next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female , uh , who was previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . hi . good afternoon , ashley . how are you doing ?
[patient] i'm doing okay . how are you .
[doctor] i'm doing well . thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers . i'm one of your kidney doctors . and you guys must be mom and dad .
[patient] yes , that's correct .
[doctor] great . well ... all right . it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we're gon na figure it all out , uh , here today . um , speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kind of move from there . would that be all right with you , ashley ?
[patient] yeah , that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small ... kind of a small kidney on one side . tell me about when that was . um , i do also have records of everything , but i'd just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here , uh , today .
[patient_guest] sure . so ashley came home one day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach , and she said it was hurting on her right side . and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain .
[doctor] okay .
[patient] we automatically thought appendix .
[doctor] sure . that makes a lot of sense .
[patient_guest] we took her to her doctor . they treated her for a stomach virus . they get her fluids and sent her back home , and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day .
[doctor] goodness . okay . then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something , and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] um , then at that time they told us to followup with our primary the next day , which we did . um , but he was heading out on vacation , so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up , in a lot of pain , so i took work off to help her .
[doctor] wow . okay .
[patient_guest] uh , we took her down to jacksonville , where they did see her and basically told us the same thing , that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one .
[doctor] all right-y . then- then what happened ?
[patient_guest] yeah . then , um , they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . um , they told us to followup with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick .
[doctor] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ?
[patient_guest] yeah . it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was , of course , still out of town with no one to see her in his place . so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about four days . um , they did see her and treated her .
[doctor] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some light at the end of that tunnel .
[patient_guest] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since , but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach .
[doctor] mhm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . well , that was a really good review . so , ashley , before all of this , would you say that , all in all , you were a pretty healthy child ?
[patient_guest] she is , yeah . before that , she was completely fine . uh , they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might've affected her kidney .
[doctor] got you . okay .
[patient_guest] so one other thing , too , um , when she was four years old she was in the hospital three or four times , sometimes for three days at a time . i do n't think they did any tests to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . um , they just gave her fluids and antibiotic and they would send us home .
[doctor] hmm . okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . and so a week or two later , she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months , and then it just stopped . so she had no problem since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's all right or if she ... if it needs to be taken out maybe . we wan na do whatever needs to be done .
[doctor] yes . absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll- we'll get you through for that . um , is ashley taking any medications daily right now ?
[patient_guest] only pepcid .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] yeah . so she takes 40 milligrams of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies .
[doctor] all right-y . and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ?
[patient_guest] no . um , renal disease does run in my family , though . my dad , aunt , and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnoses .
[doctor] great . i will definitely review that over . any other , uh , family history to be aware of ?
[patient_guest] yes . my mom had breast cancer too .
[doctor] okay . great . all right-y . so just a ... over a quick review . it does look like your- your father had a kidney transplant . is that correct ?
[patient_guest] yes , that is correct . he did .
[doctor] okay . so obstructive neuropathy . uh , it sounds like he was born with it and something , uh ... something made it so he could n't urinate correctly . does that sound right ?
[patient_guest] yes , and they did n't catch it in time .
[doctor] i'm so sorry to hear that .
[patient_guest] yeah . he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack .
[doctor] my goodness . wow . i am so sorry to hear that , um , but thank you so much for ... you know , all of these bits and pieces really help knit up a story together for ashley so we can get her the best care .
[patient_guest] you're welcome .
[doctor] okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease ?
[patient_guest] yes . well , it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt .
[doctor] okay . and ... okay . i'm looking here . it looks like ... do you know what the name of diagnosis ? it does n't seem to be mentioned .
[patient_guest] um , this is what she sent me , "" end-stage renal disease . chronic kidney disease stage five , diabetes , hypertension . "" that's all i have , uh , to work on for her .
[doctor] okay . uh , and that's ... okay . let me see . that is all when ... she was an adult when all of that happened ?
[patient_guest] correct . yep .
[doctor] all right-y . okay . and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist , where they did n't find anything sig ... clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did .
[patient_guest] yes .
[doctor] okay . so that's all good . so , ashley , um , a few questions for you if that's all right . how are you feeling right now ?
[patient] i'm not feeling too bad . my stomach just hurts just a little bit . it's burning a little bit .
[doctor] okay . and any pain when you go pee ?
[patient] sometimes it's just hard to start , sometimes .
[doctor] okay . and any blood in your pee ?
[patient] no , not that i've noticed .
[doctor] okay .
[patient_guest] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks , um , like , soda . so she'll only drink gatorade or water .
[doctor] okay . yeah . so we do see that some people are very sensitive when the drink certain items , especially the carbonation . um , it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate . um ... okay . so a lot of different pictures of her kidneys here , and we'll review all of that here in a moment . um-
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . but before we review that , i wan na look through a quick exam , uh , and just see how things are doing . you'll hear me speak aloud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] all right-y . please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart , if you'll just breathe normally for me . okay ?
[patient] okay .
[doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . all right-y . so your physical exam , you know , everything we see up here is ... you know , you're a well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today , i hope , uh , with not acute distress . exam , um , otherwise with norm ... within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us ? the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as- as does her blood pressure . we'll wan na keep on eye on both of those things , as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria , which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end of seeing protein in your pee .
[patient_guest] okay .
[doctor] or , excuse me , her pee . uh , her right kidney is a little bit smaller which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , um , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on but nothing for us to do with anything today .
[patient_guest] okay . thank you .
[doctor] i also recommend that , on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function , complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her ... in her pee , and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds good .
[doctor] okay . and does ashley play any sports ?
[patient_guest] yes . she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer .
[doctor] how fun . i used to play softball back in the day . um , so it'll be very important that during those activities she stays well-hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration , as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least two liters per day of water .
[patient_guest] okay . great . we will work on that .
[doctor] okay . i also recommended a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult . so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses .
[patient_guest] we can do that . we already do try to eat , uh , very well .
[doctor] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have come all the way out here .
[patient_guest] okay . that sounds great .
[doctor] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything ? um , you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if ... certainly , if symptoms worse .
[patient_guest] no . i do n't have any additional questions , and i'll- i'll definitely give you a- a phone call if we do . and thank you so much . this was so helpful .
[doctor] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip . and , ashley , it was really nice to meet you . mom dad , you as well . and i hope you guys take care .
[patient_guest] you too .
[doctor] all right-y . past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral bowels valves and obstructive neur- neuropathy . uh , he developed chronic kidney disease and was on dial ... was dialysis-dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . , wait . is that right ?
[patient_guest] now that you've started , it does ... i do n't understand the he unless they were giving ... , the grandfather's record . but did you wan na do this on your own this recording ?
[doctor] yeah . that's ... yeah . that'll work 'cause i'm gon na have to drop for this . but i think we're good for everything else .
[patient] and he did die in his 40s . that's what it said in the note earlier .
[doctor] okay . yeah . he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack . died at 47 of a massive heart-
[patient] he died ... it- it's saying that it meant ... it means he died on dia ... like , he was ... he was , um , utilizing dialysis .

[doctor] lem me check your record quick for for pain management it's kind of a strong drug for vicodin and we do n't really like to prescribe that unless it's totally necessary so why do n't we start with the meloxicam and i also write a referral to pain management and they can talk to you a little bit about some of your pain and maybe not using narcotics to manage it
[patient] how about some demerol

[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused

[doctor] no one likes them okay well let's i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam i'm just gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'll let you know what that means when i'm done okay so looking at your blood pressure here in the office your blood pressure looks good it's about one twenty seven over sixty which is pretty good on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention there is no carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base on your lung exam your lungs are nice and clear to auscultation bilaterally and on your musculoskeletal exam your right radial artery cardiac cath site is clean dry and intact there is no hematoma and there is a palpable radial pulse now what does that mean betty so all of that means is that you know you have a little bit of a heart murmur after having the heart attack but i looked on the echocardiogram and it showed that you know you do have mild mitral regurgitation which is just you know a little floppy valve which is is fine we'll just keep an eye on that and then everything else for the most part looks good so let's just talk a little bit about my assessment and plan okay so for your first problem of your inferior myocardial myocardial infarction i wan na go ahead and continue with your aspirin continue on your brilinta you're gon na stay on the brilinta for at least one year and aspirin you're gon na take lifelong until i tell you to okay i wan na go ahead and have you continue on the crestor forty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and put in another echocardiogram for about six months okay do you have any questions about that
[patient] yeah do you think i can no that sounds good i have one other more question though
[doctor] okay
[patient] do you think that i can swim again i miss swimming
[doctor] yeah so at this point you're you know you're out like two weeks and your and your cath site is looks good so you can go ahead and and resume swimming now with that being said i would want you to just do a few laps here and there i do want to enroll you into cardiac rehab that's gon na give you a bit more confidence to go back to exercising and they also give a lot of dietary education and counseling in cardiac rehab does that sounds like something that you can do
[patient] yeah i think i have to
[doctor] okay i agree alright i also want you to go ahead and continue with your toprol fifty milligrams once a day and i'm gon na go ahead and order a some liver function studies and a lipid panel to follow up with the next time we meet and i want to see you again in probably six weeks okay

aci_D2N190_nan,"[patient] and good morning hi beverly
[doctor] good morning
[patient] how do you see your last name
[doctor] howard
[patient] howard nice to meet you
[doctor] you too
[patient] what can i do for you today
[doctor] well i think i like fell off of my tandem bike with my partner and my knee has been hurting ever since and when did that happen
[patient] maybe like two weeks ago
[doctor] okay and which knee are we talking about
[patient] my right knee
[doctor] alright and tell me exactly what happened so we were like riding together and i think he said he saw a squirrel or something like that he's a little distractible and you know like he went down so i went down i hit it on the curb like it's really kinda it was sore i gave i i took some ibuprofen and i i like washed it out and put a band-aid on it but it's it's just been like kind of hurting everyday since then so i scheduled an appointment
[patient] okay is it getting better getting worse or just kinda lingering on
[doctor] it's it's just holding on and i tried taking like medication right i took some ibuprofen and it was fine it just like it keeps coming back and i i read on the label i'm not supposed to take that stuff for more than two weeks right
[patient] well it all it all depends everyone's different we'll get to that
[doctor] okay
[patient] and your knee was not bothering you at all before this normal knee
[doctor] yep
[patient] never okay alright what do you do for living
[doctor] well i work in a children's hospital so i like play around i i'm a i'm a a baby rocker professionally i go into like the nicu's and i i rock some of the babies
[patient] gotcha what do you do outside of outside of work is biking kinda your thing
[doctor] no that was his thing and i think that's why we fell i i should n't trust him but most of the time i go on walks with my dog
[patient] okay have you broke up with him already or
[doctor] no i did n't know that knee injury was a reason to but now that you've told me maybe we should talk about that
[patient] we'll talk about that later too
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright so let's take a let's take a peek at your knee here
[doctor] okay
[patient] you gon na stick it through the screen or how you're gon na do this alright
[doctor] okay
[patient] alright then
[doctor] i'm just i'm gon na i'm gon na grab your leg we're just gon na take it through just let it relax i'm just gon na take it through a little range of motion i'm gon na kinda poke around all different places you tell me where it hurts okay
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] alright now i'm poking i'm poking i'm poking so on the inside part here
[patient] is this where it hurts
[doctor] yeah like when you touch it it really hurts
[patient] right there okay tell me what's worse here or here
[doctor] on the inside
[patient] okay so medial joint line tenderness
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] pes bursa nontender epicondyle nontender back of her knee nice and soft any pain back here
[doctor] no i do n't think so
[patient] okay popliteal space is nontender how about over on this side
[doctor] no okay lateral side nontender skin she has got about a dime size little abrasions dry looks about a week week old right over the medial patella everything else looks good no scars okay how about can you straighten it out all the way i can but sometimes it like hurts a little bit like it almost like it clicks
[patient] yep that's good though full full extension how far can you bend it
[doctor] all the way back
[patient] okay let's see
[doctor] okay
[patient] good good and how about the other side let me see the left knee can you bend that one all the way back too
[doctor] yeah that's fine
[patient] okay full full symmetric flexion no no deformities go ahead and just let it relax
[doctor] mm-hmm valgus stress medial collateral ligament intact lateral collateral ligament intact okay so little kind of little laxity posterior drawer let me see the other let me see the other knee
[patient] mm-hmm yeah so that that feels pretty much normal so she's got a about a one plus posterior drawer anterior drawer negative lachman negative good let's go ahead and just kinda bend and straighten for me
[doctor] okay
[patient] good patellar patella tracks fine no crepitus alright let's go back to this medial side you're tender right there is that right
[doctor] yeah
[patient] it's tender on the medial joint line but actually negative mcmurray negative lateral side negative mcmurray good so pretty stable you you feel like you you're kinda shifting back a little bit on this side compared to the other side does it feel unstable when you walk does it feel like it shifts
[doctor] yeah sometimes
[patient] what's what's the worst thing that that you can do that you do n't like about that knee is it walking standing sitting still getting up from a chair in and out of the car what what do n't you like
[doctor] walking up a hill like any kind of incline really hurts
[patient] yeah and you're it's just you're weak are is it
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] you actually no
[doctor] yeah it hurts no
[patient] what about you i mean are you real weak
[doctor] no i would say i'm pretty strong
[patient] did you go to the gym
[doctor] i go to the gym but i swim so the
[patient] okay i ca n't treat people like you you you you need to work harder i quit complaining okay
[doctor] yes sir work harder okay
[patient] do you do you play sports in in college or high school
[doctor] i did in high school
[patient] yeah so and you and you still doing anything athletic now other than just rocking kids
[doctor] no
[patient] just kinda you're thinking walking the dog
[doctor] yeah rocking kids and walking dogs and going on the occasional swim
[patient] on the occasional swim alright how have you been swimming since you hurt your knee
[doctor] no no i have n't would you recommend that
[patient] well i'm not sure yet it's because we might have to do surgery on your knee here and take that leg off
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's pretty bad
[doctor] okay
[patient] we'll get we'll get to that too
[doctor] okay
[patient] so did you already have x-rays of this knee today
[doctor] yes
[patient] okay do i go into that to
[doctor] yeah
[patient] look at the x-rays do you or just stop here you can okay okay and so what would what would happen now you would you could pause it
[patient] you're only cup of this
[doctor] let's take a look at your pictures here and alright so this looks pretty just looking at it looks pretty normal looks pretty healthy you can see how i all the edges of the bones here look pretty good i do n't see any bone spurs of that i do n't see anything broken everything looked looks pretty good kneecap's tracking good you can see the space here there's no real space there that's actually cartilage so that looks pretty healthy and you can see the other side looks both both look the same so x-rays look i do n't see anything obvious on that but looking at your knee here you may have hit that tibia bone and kinda pushed that bone back it feels to me like you may very well have sprained your or injured your posterior cruciate ligament that's what it's feeling like
[patient] hmmm
[doctor] i'm not gon na know that for sure or if there is other things going on in there but i think getting an mri scan to look at what you may have done inside there i'm pretty suspicious though that you may have injured that ligament if that's the only thing you did very rarely is this gon na need surgery okay so this may be something we wan na get you into a brace here get you into some therapy and get all your motion back and get your strength back and then maybe check it back in a in a few weeks and see because a lot of times those ligaments can tighten back up
[patient] it's it's odd for just an isolated posterior ligament to need surgery
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] but if there's other things going on i ca n't tell you for sure that you did n't injure a meniscus too or maybe chipped some cartilage when that bone shifted so let's let's get an mri scan to look at that if that comes back with just a ligament like i'm suspecting hopefully this is something we can treat with some therapy and some bracing for a while and get this thing back to normal if after that couple months later or so you still have instability and still bothering you then it's possible we may have to do some surgery to fix that ligament
[doctor] okay
[patient] does that make sense
[doctor] yeah yeah so in the meantime though do you want me to still keep taking the ibuprofen yeah i think that's fine for a short if it's helping the big thing right now is we want to get your strength back and your motion back get rid of the swelling that we still see here
[patient] okay
[doctor] so that will help with that ice ice packs a few times a day you can take the ibuprofen up to three times a day and i'll look i'll we'll look at the dose here there are some other medicines we can try that maybe do n't have to take so often that may be easier
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] so i can even send in a prescription for you for something that maybe just twice a day a little easier for you to take without skipping doses
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay you can just take it with breakfast and dinner
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] we'll try and see if it works better if your ibuprofen works better though go ahead and just go back to that but we can try this other prescription first
[patient] okay
[doctor] it's not very expensive and i can just call it into your pharmacy
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then we can we can get the brace fitted to you today we are not gon na look at a big big custom kind of expensive brace we will just put because it may just be temporary
[patient] mm-hmm mm-hmm
[doctor] and then i will get you a referral to physical therapy something that you can do close to home or close to work
[patient] and then maybe i could see you back here in maybe four to six weeks and recheck this
[doctor] okay how often am i gon na have to go to physical therapy
[patient] i'm gon na kinda leave that up to you and the and the therapist i would start with a couple visits and then we'll just really see how you progress and what you can do at home if what if you have access to some equipment or things that we need to do but i want you to go you know at least a few times so somebody can kinda keep an eye on you make sure you're doing the exercises right
[doctor] okay alright i think that sounds good
[patient] did you get did you select you last night
[doctor] i did
[patient] you yeah what do you think what do you roof for
[doctor] i so i i'm a little heart broken right now i was for the rockets and the way that these nets are crushing them it's just it's just painful
[patient] are you serious
[doctor] yeah
[patient] rockets
[doctor] i live in dallas yes
[patient] yeah yeah that's not that's not my problem though you have not do you not watch the bulls
[doctor] no no
[patient] my gosh alright we're gon na have to work on you

[patient] okay

[patient] yeah it it waxes and wanes in severity it it's in general probably around a four or a five but sometimes it gets up as high as a seven or eight
[doctor] okay is there anything that you notice that makes that pain worse or better like rest or movement or eating or anything else
[patient] it's usually a little worse after a meal
[doctor] hmmm okay

[doctor] okay alright and do you notice that pain radiates anywhere or moves you know any or anywhere

[patient] i have not usually they are responsive to just excedrin migraine i use the sumatriptan when i need to if it if it does n't respond to the over the counter analgesic
[doctor] okay
[patient] so
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it's been it they've been pretty rare
[doctor] okay okay great yeah you've learned a lot about it and and the treatments including the the term analgesic and all of that that's pretty impressive you've been you've been through the ringer i think with with those so okay and so you're taking excedrin when you get a migraine and then sort of would you say maybe for breakthrough migraines or worse migraines you'd take a sumatriptan occasionally
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay got it and how about your blood pressure how has that been running at home are you checking your blood pressures daily still and how how your how how have your blood pressures been
[patient] i have not been checking them daily i i probably check it about two or three times a week
[doctor] hmmm
[patient] and they're pretty good the upper number is usually around in the one twenties or low one thirties and the lower number usually in the seventies
[doctor] okay okay not not too bad it does look like you're a little bit elevated today i i maybe i'm just making you nervous though so i hope not so are you but you're still on lisinopril twenty milligrams per day correct it looks like you might be running low do you need a refill of that
[patient] yeah actually i was going to ask you about that if i could get a refill that would be great
[doctor] sure we can do that and so okay but you are still taking that twenty milligrams per day correct
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay and alright fair enough so so let's go ahead and and examine you now karen so on your physical exam pretty normal and and unremarkable for the most part on your on your heart exam i do hear that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that you've still got that's unchanged from prior exam that just means i hear some heart sounds you know as i'm listening to your heart there i'm not too concerned about that we'll watch that otherwise normal cardiovascular exam and then your your abdominal exam gastrointestinal exam you have some tenderness in the right upper quadrant i would say mild to moderate tenderness and now if you take a deep breath does that and i press here does that hurt you
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay yeah you have i would call an equivocal murphy's sign in the right upper quadrant on your abdominal examination as well the rest of your abdomen is soft and no significant tenderness you have no tenderness in the right lower quadrant with deep palpation and you have no cva tenderness on your back exam as well and so we will talk about about that i am a little bit concerned about the tenderness that that i find on your abdominal exam the remainder of your exam karen is pretty normal and unremarkable and and so that's good let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan so first of all for your first problem of abdominal pain you you do seem to have acute abdominal pain with right upper quadrant tenderness that i'm concerned maybe a sign of some gallstones or possibly even an infection in your gallbladder so i'm gon na order some blood tests and an ultrasound today i'm gon na order a cbc chem twelve urinalysis a pregnancy test and also right upper quadrant ultrasound and so we will we will get those tests done right away i'm gon na keep you here we'll see how those look fortunately we've got the facilities for those and if we need to send you to the emergency department based on those results we will i do n't want you to eat anything right now okay in case we find something that might require surgery alright unlikely but it's possible and then okay you know karen i meant to ask you on your history one thing by chance have you had a fever along with this abdominal pain

[patient] normally my blood pressure has been very well controlled over about the last three to four weeks there have been periods where i felt a little lightheaded slight headache and when i checked my blood pressure the upper number has been occasionally over one eighty which is way past you know what any of the numbers have been in the past

[patient] i've done it both when i felt fine and then when i had the lightheaded episodes actually it's been on the high side
[doctor] okay alright understood and you have n't passed out or anything have you

[patient] little unsteady when i get the dizziness and a slight headache when the blood pressure numbers have been a little higher
[doctor] okay and when you say dizzy are you feeling lightheaded like you might pass out or you feeling that the world spinning around you or what
[patient] just a little fuzzy where you just feel more lightheaded

[patient] yes i am
[doctor] okay you are not missing doses or anything are you by chance
[patient] very rarely
[doctor] okay great great you're still using that pill box that we suggested i think you had a pretty good system going there maybe maybe you're using that app now to take to keep track of one when to take your medicine are you doing that
[patient] yes yeah i've i've used the pillbox and then tried the app it was a little confusing but i'm i'm pretty much on on track with staying on my medication schedule pretty accurately
[doctor] that's great i think i think i remember you saying it was tricky to get that app set up but then your grandson helped you with it and those kids amazing what they can do these days right anything like that i always trust them my kids before me so hey by the way how did he do in his softball or in his in his little league tournament last month i think you said he had a big tournament coming up how did that go
[patient] they they did great they they got all the way to the finals and then the team that the team that beat them was probably a little older a little bit more season but they had a great time
[doctor] wow wow how fun that's fantastic well congrats good stuff alright well listen so so you're still taking your your lisinopril how about for your hyperlipidemia your your high cholesterol there are you still taking that atorvastatin
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay excellent and your osteoarthritis i know you've been you know a golfer in the past and you know you wan na get out on the course and things is that still under control are you able to get out and and and walk the full course and things still
[patient] most of the time you know there are times when the weather changes that i have to maybe play less play less or or skip a day
[doctor] yeah yeah but you're still okay well you're still able to get out and then you're kinda taking i think you're taking some tylenol for for you know mild mild pain and changing your activity as needed is that right
[patient] correct
[doctor] okay alright good good okay well listen let's go ahead and examine you here jerry so on your physical exam for the most part it's pretty normal and unremarkable on your heart exam you still have that grade three out of six systolic ejection murmur that's unchanged from your prior and just means yeah i'm hearing some heart sounds from the valves that's that's not surprising and i'm not concerned about it we're just watching that one otherwise on your your lung exam you have some mild bibasilar rales but no wheezes or rhonchi and excellent air movement and you have trace lower extremity edema on your extremity exam there bilaterally and otherwise really pretty normal exam so let's let's talk about my assessment and your plan alright so first of all for your first problem of your elevated blood pressure i do think your blood pressure is a little bit out of control meaning we need to make some adjustments i'm going to actually increase your your lisinopril to sixty milligrams twice per day and i'm also going to add twenty five milligrams per day of hydrochlorothiazide and that should help even things out i want you to check your blood pressure measurements twice a day for me for the next two weeks then let's see you back in two weeks and we'll we'll check on how you're doing and also for your second problem of hyperlipidemia i i wan na keep you on the atorvastatin i'm also going to send couple of blood tests i'm gon na send a cholesterol panel also a cbc with differential and a comprehensive metabolic panel and we'll check a urinalysis as well look and see how your kidneys are doing there as well and so we'll continue the current management with your atorvastatin there for your hyperlipidemia now for your third problem osteoarthritis i want you to continue to stay active as best you can do n't over do it but walking and you know getting out golfing when you can that's great you can take tylenol for the pain if you have some mild some mild pain there and yeah otherwise i think that cover it i think the adjustments in your blood pressure medicine should help and i wan na see you back in four weeks no let's make two weeks in follow-up and otherwise any questions for me how does that sound
[patient] i do n't think so anything that i need to do when the weather warms up as far as you know my fluids drinking liquids and things
[doctor] yeah you know be sure you're staying well hydrated you know six to eight glasses of water per day is a good good idea and you you know when when it warms up you're certainly gon na prespire more and lose lose more fluid so so i would i would recommend that you continue to have you know a a standard six to eight glasses of of fluid intake per day but yeah that you know that should do it and if you're feeling particularly dehydrated you might wan na increase that if you have an increased activity level so alright any other questions for me

[patient] if i did n't take the tylenol
[doctor] yeah and have you ever had headaches like this before
[patient] not like this you know you know as you know sometimes i get migraine but i know i never really take anything for it that's like once a year or once or every two years but not like not like this one headaches like this one
[doctor] okay and have you had any congestion anything like that cough runny nose
[patient] yeah i thought maybe because you know now it's springtime and i tend to get my allergies but it it's it's very different and i've not actually had any like runny nose or cough or congestion along with the headache
[doctor] okay if you tap on your forehead do you have any tenderness
[patient] right here
[doctor] yeah
[patient] just a little not really too much
[doctor] okay if you tap down here on these bones your cheek bones any tenderness there
[patient] a little bit not as much as i guess if i tap up here
[doctor] okay and then if you kinda push on your neck around here any tenderness
[patient] it it's a little tender but it's not it is a little bit i'd say
[doctor] okay okay so you do n't have any frontal sinus tenderness no maxillary sinus tenderness it sounds like you do n't have any lymphadenopathy that would just be if your lymph nodes were tender so yeah you know let's just talk about a few things that i wan na do and then i want you to actually come in and and be seen by doctor ruth so first off your headache i think taking tylenol is great you can keep taking that you know your lisinopril you're on twenty milligrams once a day which is a medium dose but i think we can increase that so for your hypertension and your headaches i'm gon na have you increase your lisinopril to forty milligrams once a day
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then i want you to keep checking your blood pressure and i wan na order some blood tests i'd like to get some just normal blood work we'll get a hemoglobin a1c some laboratory tests things like that and and then for your diabetes i'm gon na have some diabetic education for you that i want you to be able to review it sounds like your blood sugar has been running a little bit high and after you get the blood tests after that's all done i want you to come in to see me or doctor ruth and we'll just make sure that everything is okay that we get your blood pressure under control any questions for me
[patient] no i mean i've been walking and i know i get the headaches but is it alright if i still continue my walks

[doctor] no it's fine how about your water consumption
[patient] yes but i've been drinking a lot more water and i do realize that i i wake up sometimes during the night to you know use the restroom to pee more than i normally do
[doctor] okay so we have noticed an increase in urine output okay how do you have like any normal activities are you playing any sports
[patient] yeah i ride i ride a bike every so often

[patient] thank you
[doctor] okay but how is school like are you like are are things going well like are you enjoying like your your time there
[patient] yeah school is actually going well gotten good grades
[doctor] nice
[patient] although my my physics teachers socks cheese
[doctor] they usually do anybody who chooses to engage in physics for the rest of their life i question their choices it's fine okay but are you when you're like while you are at school like has anybody been sick i know like with you know covid has been going around but like have you noticed anybody like that sick all the time around you
[patient] sick all the time everybody is sick these days
[doctor] alright
[patient] so
[doctor] but what about at home how about your siblings are any of them sick
[patient] most of them are healthy yeah most of them are healthy although you know i have a brother who smokes i have told him not to smoke he does n't listen
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] house told not to smoke at the house but you know anyway
[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerular nephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay
[patient] got it
[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in
[patient] do i need to get a shot today
[doctor] no shots today just stopped
[patient] okay and when do i have to come back for the results
[doctor] i need you to come back in a week
[patient] okay can we do that over the phone by the way
[doctor] we could if if your results are normal but if we need to have additional conversations i'm gon na need you to come back

[patient] yeah i think that's the big pill
[doctor] okay i'm not really sure what it looks like but you're supposed to be taking a thousand milligrams twice a day are you taking it twice a day
[patient] yeah i'm taking my wife puts in the my box i take something twice a day i know that
[doctor] okay how is your wife doing she is a very lovely person i i i remember seeing her at your last visit
[patient] she is doing fine
[doctor] she
[patient] as long as she stays on the other side of the house no
[doctor] yeah i say the same thing to my husband okay well let's go ahead i wanted you to just do a quick physical exam so i'm gon na be calling out some of my exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so looking here at your vital signs you know you do n't have a fever here in the office which is good your temperature is ninety eight . four on your blood pressure it seems like you are doing a pretty good job monitoring your blood pressure your blood pressure is right where it should be it's about one twenty five over sixty two which is good your heart rate is nice and slow in the eighties and your oxygenation is fine it's ninety seven percent on room air so all of that is is really good now on on your facial exam i'm just pressing on your face here do you have any pain to palpation
[patient] just right underneath my eyes
[doctor] on one on what side
[patient] actually both
[doctor] okay okay on on facial examination the patient has pain to palpation of the bilateral maxillary sinuses on nasal exam there are there is erythema and edema of the nasal turbinates bilaterally with associated yellow discharge on throat exam can you open up your mouth on your throat exam the the uvula is midline there is no erythema or edema or exudate in the peritonsillar space on neck examination i do appreciate some bilateral cervical lymphadenopathy and on your lung exam there is coarse rhonchi present bilaterally that clears with cough on your heart exam your heart is in a nice regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur and on your right knee exam does it hurt when i press here
[patient] yep
[doctor] okay there is pain to palpation on the right knee and i'm just gon na move it all around does that hurt
[patient] little bit yeah
[doctor] okay so there is decreased flexion and extension of the right knee there is associated ecchymosis to the right medial knee there is no evidence of an effusion okay so billy what does all of that mean that means that you just have signs of that you have a little bit of an upper respiratory infection that might have caused some congestion in your in your lungs which we will talk about okay and then and as far as your knee exam it just shows that you do have some inflammation and some evidence that you had injured it earlier so let's just talk a little bit about you know my assessment and my plan for you for all of these issues okay so for your first problem of your cough you know i do believe that you just have a a viral syndrome at this time you probably have some mild bronchitis i really just wan na go ahead and just you know recommend some supportive care you can continue to take over the counter medications we can prescribe guaifenesin six hundred six hundred milligrams twice a day to help cough up some of that phlegm and i do n't think you need need any antibiotics at this time but certainly if your symptoms worsen i want you to call me and then we can go ahead and consider ordering a chest x-ray to make sure that you do n't have any pneumonia okay how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good
[doctor] okay so for your second problem of your right knee pain i do believe you have a a a right medial collateral ligament strain from the fall this morning and i really wan na just go ahead and and i'll prescribe some meloxicam fifteen milligrams once a day and we can refer you to physical therapy to help strengthen those muscles around that area and i'm gon na go ahead and just order a right knee x-ray just to make sure that you did n't injure any bones although i do n't think you did but we'll just go ahead and order that right knee x-ray how does that sound
[patient] okay that sounds like good good plan
[doctor] okay and then for your third problem of your hypertension let's just continue on the lisinopril twenty milligrams a day i wan na go ahead and order a lipid panel to make sure everything is okay from that standpoint and lastly your fourth problem your diabetes i wan na go ahead and order a hemoglobin a1c just to make sure we do n't have to make any adjustments to your metformin and i really want you to try to monitor your sugar intake and report your blood sugars to me through the patient portal how does that sound
[patient] okay i'll try that i try my best
[doctor] alright that sounds good i'll i'll be in touch with you with those results okay
[patient] okay appreciate it

[patient] hmmm i probably take it when i take my other medicine like every other day
[doctor] every other day okay so i do see that you know the nurse took your your vital signs this morning that your blood pressure is running quite a bit high it was like one seventy two over ninety eight so that's that's really a little higher than where we want it to be especially that you're on your medication but what we're gon na do is we're gon na take i'm gon na take a look at you real quick and then we can discuss you know maybe there's some changes that we can do in terms of your current regimen how about diet and your have you been sticking with that low sodium diet at all

[doctor] i love mcdonald's too my favorite is big mac i do n't know about you but i got ta have my big mac with those large fries which you what's your favorite mcdonald's treat there
[patient] i need to think of what fully of fish i love flare of fish
[doctor] well at least you're eating the fish but but they can be very high in sodium especially the fast foods so we'll have to talk about maybe they can look at you know some some diet changes as well so the other thing is for your for your blood sugar here i see that you know you're running a bit high as well it looks like you're like you're about one seventy this morning and i i i i assume that you were fasting last night is that right okay so that's that's a little higher than what we want it's not bad it's below two hundred but it's getting kinda close to the borderline from where our limit is so we will take we take a look at that and also we'll figure out what we can do with that as well alright so at this point how about are you how is how is work how is life it's been good otherwise how's the family

aci_D2N201_nan,"[doctor] hey steven so i see that you're here and you've been experiencing some back pain for a while could you tell me a bit about that
[patient] yeah it's been back has been hurting for a while
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] for about a couple of years and tried a couple things but nothing seems to work
[doctor] okay so let's start start with what happened did something cause the pain
[patient] i think well i played basketball and i bumped one time and i fell and i hit i think i fell on my back got fell real hard
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] so it's been hurting after ever since that
[doctor] okay and then how severe is the pain on a scale of like one to ten
[patient] i think it's around a seven
[doctor] wow okay could you describe it for me is it like sharp is it throbbing
[patient] it it hurts pretty bad it's it's sharp
[doctor] okay
[patient] throbs sometimes
[doctor] and does it radiate
[patient] sometimes it hurts more than others and i'm not sure why
[doctor] and does it radiate anywhere
[patient] yeah it goes down my leg my left leg
[doctor] okay alright
[patient] like my toes get numb a little sometimes
[doctor] wow okay and how about like so hmmm you said it goes down your left leg how about any like are you experiencing any loss of sensation in like the genital or rectal area
[patient] i hope not
[doctor] that's okay i i it's gon na help me isolate like what's what exactly is going on so please do n't feel embarrassed to answer the questions do you have any weakness
[patient] yeah sometimes i try to stand up and and and like i i ca n't go get weak or if i'm standing up for too long
[doctor] okay so would you would you say that there are certain positions that make you feel better or worse
[patient] yeah like lying on my side makes me feel better
[doctor] okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] and then you said that standing also makes it worse right
[patient] yeah if i stand for a while
[doctor] okay and then have you experienced any like loss of control of like your bladder or your bowels
[patient] yeah i pooped myself once
[doctor] okay so incontinence just once though like over the last two years right it's not like a consistent thing
[patient] no it's not consistent i think i stood up for too long i think i was drinking too
[doctor] okay okay you mentioned earlier that you tried some things in the past like what were they
[patient] so i i had a doc gave me some injections before i'm not sure what they were though
[doctor] okay alright and i see in your chart here that you had physical therapy did you feel that that was effective
[patient] no i feel like i could do them the same exercises at my house like they charged me and like it
[doctor] okay but did the did the exercises help
[patient] i mean i guess a little
[doctor] okay not a so not as effective as we would have liked did they put you on any pain medications
[patient] yeah it was just a white pill i'm not sure what it was
[doctor] okay do n't worry i think i can look that up in your chart i just wan na make sure that we have the story straight alright so i know that you said that you mentioned that you played basketball you know before how how like what's your activity like now
[patient] i mean i sit at home all day
[doctor] okay
[patient] watch tv
[doctor] okay
[patient] so not very active i've gained about eighty pounds the past year
[doctor] okay that's a pretty okay that's a pretty significant weight gain well i i just have a few more questions have you do you know if any of your family members have spine conditions
[patient] i think my fourth cousin has scoliosis
[doctor] okay okay but that's that's a little distant but anybody direct like sister brother mom dad
[patient] i do n't think so i mean i do n't even my dad though
[doctor] okay okay and then do you have a personal history of smoking
[patient] what type of smoking
[doctor] any smoke you do n't have to tell me exactly but
[patient] okay
[doctor] have you smoked
[patient] next maybe that i have n't
[doctor] are you it's okay i'm your doctor i'm not here to judge you i just want to make sure that i'm like you know when the conclusions that we come to and like my assessment and plan for you i need to know this information so one more time do you smoke or have you smoked before
[patient] okay i smoked
[doctor] okay that's fine how much and how often and what was it
[patient] i'm not telling you all that i'm just telling you i smoked
[doctor] okay you have
[patient] too many questions are you the fit
[doctor] i'm your doctor i have to
[patient] are you the fence you sound like the fence next question
[doctor] i'm not a op i promise alright that's fine but let me know are you currently like smoking
[patient] no
[doctor] okay okay i just have to ask alright so i do wan na do a quick physical exam i did review your vitals and like part of why i wan na know about your smoking history is that you are stating kind of low like it looks like you are might be in the ninety five percentile range and so we might need to explore some things
[patient] sent them off yeah
[doctor] pardon
[patient] because i'm fat my cousin was fat too and and he gained a bunch of weight he he had to have oxygen
[doctor] you know honestly there are a few other factors weight gain does n't necessarily help you're right but like smoking has like a stronger impact so but it's okay we can explore like you know other options here i as i listen to your heart you have a regular rate and rhythm i do n't appreciate any murmur on so i'm gon na go ahead and do a back exam i do n't notice any overlying erythema or ecchymosis on your skin so no redness or bruising when i push here on your spine does that hurt okay okay so there is midline tenderness on the l4 l5 disk space with right sided lumbar paravertebral tenderness when you bend forward does it hurt
[patient] yeah it hurts
[doctor] okay and when you bend backward does it hurt
[patient] a little bit
[doctor] okay so pain with lumbar flexion and extension alright and as i raise your leg does this hurt when i raise your leg up
[patient] stop
[doctor] okay so supine straight leg test positive alright just a couple more things on neurological examination there is decreased sensation to light touch at the right lateral thigh at l4 dermatome patella and achilles reflexes are symmetrical so i just wanted to make sure that i documented all of that in your chart and in a you can ask me any questions but i did look over the results of the
[patient] what does that mean like am i dying
[doctor] no no no you're not dying but i think we have i think i have a good idea of what's causing your back pain so first let's talk about the mri that you had the results show a disk desiccation a disk bulge with parison paracentral disk herniation resulting in moderate right for neural foraminal stenosis okay
[patient] that's a big word
[doctor] those are huge words it's okay so let me tell you what like what all this means and what we're gon na do like for my assessment and plan so for your problem of chronic lumbar back pain based on your symptoms your exam and reviewing your mri that's consistent with a herniated disk at the l4 l5 with radiculopathy what this means is that one of your disks that sits between your spinal vertebrae is bulging out and this bulge is pinching on some nerves that's why you feel the tingling in your leg alright so that it's also why you felt pain when i pushed on that area so i'm gon na recommend some a spinal injection with a strong anti-inflammatory medication called a corticosteroid right i think you said that you had one before but i think this is something
[patient] i had to have someone hold me down i do n't like needles so do you can i take a pill i do n't want that
[doctor] we could yeah we could give you something to help calm down like the anxiety i would just write you a prescription for one and you would take that maybe three hours before you came in for your appointment and then you should feel calm enough to be able to do the injection
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright
[patient] can i get pain pills too
[doctor] can you
[patient] for pain
[doctor] can you get what now
[patient] pain pills
[doctor] so once i inject the cotocoid steroid in the in your spine it's gon na happen under fluoroscopy right and it's going to be it's a it's just a type of of like x-ray sorry to because i need to be very specific in where i do this injection so i say this because you should n't need anymore pain pills after we do this injection it should help with the inflammation and directly target the bulge to help you out so after this injection give it maybe a day and if you say that you're still experiencing pain then we can talk about maybe giving you pain medication but remember before you said it was n't as effective so i think this steroid shot is the best chance that we have
[patient] i'd say it was n't effective
[doctor] okay sorry i i i saw that they gave you strong pain meds but remember you said the white one did you say it was effective
[patient] yeah i said i said the white ones i said they worked
[doctor] okay i'm sorry so alright so maybe when let's okay so what we're still gon na do though we're gon na do the injection and then if it still hurts after that then we can explore that pain medication i do n't want you to have to consistently be on pain medication it's not necessarily like a good long term solution if after we monitor this you still are experiencing pain we are gon na try the pain meds however i would maybe recommend surgery
[patient] i do n't want i know
[doctor] right and so this is we're just gon na try everything that we can before you know before we get to that place
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] do you have any questions
[patient] no
[doctor] alright
[patient] when it when is it when am i having this this when do you want me to get this injection
[doctor] okay so you're gon na go to the front and schedule it this is a very quick and common procedure it should only take about an hour we will need to do this note like if this if this is successful we would only maybe do this four times a year so whenever at the front desk go ahead and schedule i think that mine pretty available to be able to help you with this alright any other questions

[doctor] okay so a little bit about my physical exam i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you today now your vitals look good but specifically on your right shoulder exam you do have limited active and passive range of motion and there is tenderness to the greater tuberosity of the humerus now there is no tenderness at your sternoclavicular joint and you do have good strong bilateral hand grips and on your neurovascular exam of your right arm you do have brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds and you do have equal and bilateral response to sensation and touch which is good now taking a look at your x-ray that we did when you came in today good news is that right shoulder x-ray reveals no fracture or bony abnormality mkay so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan now i your symptoms are most likely due to rotator cuff tendinopathy i think that you've injured the tendons of the muscles that make up the shoulder so that i think that's that's why you are having the that shoulder pain i do wan na order an mri of that right shoulder just to make sure that nothing else is going on now i'm gon na refer you to physical therapy and that's gon na be about six to eight weeks now my patients are very successful with their pt and let's see how you do before we make the decision that we would do additional treatment such as a steroid injection to that shoulder i do want you to continue to take an nsaid if you can tolerate tylenol i want you to go ahead and take tylenol for that pain do you have any questions comments or concerns about our treatment plan
[patient] no i think it sounds good ca n't wait to to get some relief
[doctor] okay so i know we ordered it for six to eight weeks but i wan na see you again in two weeks and we'll evaluate how you're doing and make some additional treatment plan at that at that time okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright sounds good we will get the nurse come in and she will take care of you and i will see you in two weeks

aci_D2N203_nan,"[doctor] good afternoon matthew how are you
[patient] i'm okay
[doctor] it looks like here that the that you've been brought in for some vision changes and looks like you're having trouble with your right eye can you tell me a little bit about what brought you in to see me today
[patient] yeah you know i started noticing my wife and i we we eat out almost every night and it's when especially when we go to fancy place
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i have trouble adjusting in the that dark dim environment
[doctor] okay and i reviewed my technician's notes before i came in to see you and it says you know you you've been having that decreased vision when you're reading especially in dark place like you just said but it also mentions here that it looks like you told her that when you look at straight lines like in your door frame it looks like things have been looking a little crooked to you how long has that been going on
[patient] well you know it's been going on a little while probably getting worse over the last three to four months and you know my my office has paneling and you know how that paneling has that dark grooves in it those straight lines well they always look wavy to me
[doctor] okay alright so it's been going on a few months now you mentioned that you and your wife go out to eat every night have you tried the new the new italium place over there on main street
[patient] my gosh yes we were just there the other night down in the it's down in the basement of that big building yeah we went there the other night and i got ta tell you it was like the saprano family was sitting across from us there was this bunch of old guys that had bottles of of red wine all over the table and they were my gosh it was so good and the food i mean i mean i ca n't tell you how great the food was
[doctor] it was
[patient] it was just phenomenal
[doctor] it was amazing my wife and i went over there the other day and when we walked downstairs it was like i was walking into a scene out of saprano's
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] but the food was amazing it was the best egg plant parmer's john i've i've ever had where really super excited about going back there here very very soon
[patient] yeah i had the bio marsal and it was my gosh it was to die for
[doctor] i'll have to get that next time i go so in reviewing your paperwork here it looks like you made mention that you smoke are you still smoking about a pack a day
[patient] yeah i i tried i've tried i've done hypnosis i've done lozenges i've done chewing gum and i get real close but you know i'll just go out one evening without the wife and and the next thing i know i'm i'm you know buying a cigarette off of somebody and it's it's really hard for me to get that stopped
[doctor] yeah i i appreciate that but it's really gon na be important that you try to to either cut back or quit smoking altogether now that leads me into my next concern here it looks like you have a history of high blood pressure and i'm just wondering are you are you taking your blood pressure medication as prescribed and and are you checking your blood pressures on a regular basis
[patient] i'm glad you just mentioned that because i have n't taken my blood pressure pill for a while it's up in the cupboard and it's back in that corner and i just i ca n't forget to take it
[doctor] okay it's really gon na be important that you take your medication for your blood pressure as prescribed i'd really like to see you start doing that today and then let's let's go ahead and and let's set that that pill bottle down on the counter and see if that does n't help you remember to take that blood pressure medicine if it's okay with you i would like to do a a quick physical exam on your eyes i'm gon na go ahead and take off your glasses and put your chin here in the chin rest for me
[patient] okay that's a bright light
[doctor] yeah i'm sorry about that it it's just gon na help me check the lenses in both of your eyes so it looks like the anterior segment examination reveals posterior chamber intraocular lenses in both eyes for the right eye the cornea is clear no nvi peak hole cup to disc is . two fundus examination of the right eye shows the retina to be attached three hundred and sixty degrees no holes or tears noted and rpe changes in the fovea now the posterior segment exam shows drusen in the macula retinal thickening and presence of subretinal fluid and exudate accumulation and it is positive for a hemorrhage now for your left eye the cornea is clear no mvi pecal cup to disc is . three rpe changes in the fovea no hemorrhage noted or subretinal fluid noted and the retina is attached appropriately now i reviewed the results of your diagnostic exam so the otc exam shows those drusen deposits under the rpe which is the retinal pigment epithelium and then the subretinal fluid so the srf accumulation and choroidal neovascular membrane can also be visualized in that test now the fluorescein angiography so the using the the fluorescein there reveals that the focal area of the leakage in the right eye is consistent with neurovascular age related macular degeneration now for my impression and plan it looks like the diagnostic test and the eye exams are consistent with the neovascular age related macular degeneration also called wet macular degeneration now it's advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss happening now this happens when those abnormal blood vessels start to grow beneath the retina what happens is they leak fluid and blood which is wides called wet macular degeneration and what happens is secondary to that it creates a large blind spot in the center of your visual field that's why it it kinda looks like you'll see a black dot in the center of your vision field now it is the most common cause of severe vision loss now the good news is we have a plan for you for this now once a month i want to give you an injection of lucent now it's gon na be injected in the vitreous portion of the eye after we numb the eye so you're not gon na feel any pain and those injections yeah i know the one once i numb the eye you wo n't feel any pain in that injection at all patients report no pain at all for the actual injection
[patient] have you ever somebody stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] well
[patient] what i mean not not yeah literally stick a needle in your eye
[doctor] yeah literally yeah
[patient] yeah
[doctor] the good news is injection given over time can slow the rate of the vision decline and maybe even stop it however i also have to let you know that there could be a situation where you may still note a small amount of vision loss but this is your best chance of maintaining that vision for as long as you can so i know i have given you a lot of information i wan na pause here and see if you have any questions comments or concerns before we get you scheduled for that injection
[patient] no i'm i mean as as long as you think it wo n't hurt a lot that will be good
[doctor] okay i think it's gon na be our best plan to help slow this disease process
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you prepped and we're gon na go ahead and do the first injection today
[patient] okay okay
[doctor] sounds good i'll be back in a couple of minutes

The diagnostic tests and eye exams are consistent with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, also called wet macular degeneration.  
The neovascular age-related macular degeneration has advanced to a stage that usually leads to more severe vision loss.  
In neovascular age-related macular degeneration, abnormal blood vessels grow beneath the retina.  
In neovascular age-related macular degeneration, the abnormal blood vessels leak fluid and blood.  
The patient’s condition creates a large blind spot in the center of the visual field.  
The patient may see a black dot in the center of the visual field.  
Neovascular age-related macular degeneration is the most common cause of severe vision loss.  
The treatment plan is to give the patient an injection of Lucentis once a month.  
The Lucentis injection will be given into the vitreous portion of the eye.  
The eye will be numbed before the Lucentis injection.  
Patients report no pain for the actual Lucentis injection after numbing.  
Lucentis injections given over time can slow the rate of vision decline.  
Lucentis injections may stop the vision decline.  
The patient may still experience a small amount of vision loss despite treatment.  
The Lucentis injections are considered the patient’s best chance of maintaining vision for as long as possible.  
The plan is to perform the first Lucentis injection today."

aci_D2N205_nan,"[doctor] hey angela how are you
[patient] i'm good how are you
[doctor] i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three nonsmol cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today
[patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath
[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk
[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have
[patient] i have a dobrman
[doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm
[patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm
[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of sysplatin and a topicide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation umitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five grade yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay
[patient] okay

[patient] no
[doctor] alright so we will get you those medications those prescriptions and then we will see you back in two weeks

aci_D2N206_nan,"[doctor] hey joshua good to see you today so take a look at your chart here brenda and i see that you're coming in you you have i think you have a kidney stone so can you tell me what's going on how are you feeling and you're my my patient
[patient] and i'm your patient yeah
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i've been having pains let's just say for the last two weeks
[doctor] okay
[patient] it's it starts up in the right flank and radiates down to my groin and you know it it's under control but i have bouts where it kinda gets a little out of control
[doctor] okay so is it is it a constant pain or does it come and go for you
[patient] it comes and goes it depends on how much i've been drinking and you know what sort of activities i've been doing but it's still there
[doctor] alright so have you noticed any pain when you've been urinating
[patient] not really
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine
[patient] no blood i did have an episode where the pain radiated to one of my testicles which was kinda weird but but yeah it it sort of calmed down a little bit in that regards
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking some ibuprofen and that kinda like calms it down a little bit but it persists
[doctor] okay and what would you say like your pain score is out of ten
[patient] it's probably a four out of ten when it gets a little more out of control for the most part it's probably in the order of one or two out of ten
[doctor] okay so it is it's it's it's not too bad
[patient] it's a new ones yeah but i know it's there it does n't go away
[doctor] okay yeah yeah a lot of my patients you know have that that minor pain so you
[patient] i'm a horrible active by the way
[doctor] no yeah that's that's that's totally fine that's totally fine you know i'm just playing the doctor on tv so good good alright so have you had any other symptoms nausea vomiting anything like that
[patient] no nausea no vomiting i had some i felt like it might have been like chills but no fevers nothing along those lines
[doctor] okay that's good do you know anybody in your family that has had kidney stones in the past
[patient] yeah all in my family has had kidney stones in the past
[doctor] no well they did n't set you up good did they
[patient] yeah i i i guess i can blame them but but yeah it's been a it's been an issue with the family for as long as i've been aware of
[doctor] okay alright and i'm reading here it looks like you've had them before as well right
[patient] i have yeah i passed some by myself and i've had to have surgery a couple of times as well
[doctor] okay so the ones that you passed by yourself how many days would you say it would take to to pass
[patient] usually within within a week i manage to to get them out
[doctor] okay alright so you got anything fun plan for the weekend
[patient] just getting this pain under control
[doctor] okay well that that sounds like a good plan we can definitely help you out with that alright so i'm gon na do a quick physical exam on you looks like your blood pressure is a little bit elevated and i think that's probably because you're in pain and that's understandable everything else looks fine so on pressing on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] no no no pain
[doctor] alright so press here in the back and your cva does that back here in
[patient] yeah it's a little tender yeah it's little tender
[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of high flow nephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to
[patient] yeah yeah yeah yeah that's what i want
[doctor] what that is okay so do you have any other questions for me
[patient] no i'm friend
[doctor] alright so i'll see you again in two weeks i'll have my nurse come in and bring you that prescription for the tramadol and i think we are all good

[doctor] okay alright so let's talk a little bit about that now i know that you have a history of coronary disease you know you had had a heart attack back in twenty eighteen we put that stent in your right coronary artery i know that the pumping function of your heart was a little low you know that what we call that ejection fraction was about thirty five percent have you been watching your salt intake
[patient] yeah but you know it's been the holidays the last couple of weeks and you know i we've had a bunch of family get togethers and i i do n't think my diet has been everything it should have been

[doctor] okay now are you able to take tylenol do you not feel any relief from tylenol when you take it
[patient] yeah tylenol's lovely it just is not very effective
[doctor] okay alright yeah because i think we really want you to stay away from that those anti-inflammatories because that can make your kidney function worse and obviously you know we do n't wan na see you go on dialysis or anything like that so we'll have
[patient] mean neither
[doctor] right so we'll have to you know really work on that now tell me a little bit about are you watching the potassium and stuff in your diet

[doctor] okay yeah so you want
[patient] i did n't know what high potassium foods are
[doctor] okay i'm sorry i've never talked to you about that in the past i that's my fault so yeah so you wan na make sure you stay away from things like bananas oranges you know potatoes have lots of potassium that type of thing and so you know because with your kidney function you know that can cause your potassium levels to go up because you do n't get rid of the potassium as you should you know
[patient] something to eat
[doctor] what's that
[patient] is there anything left is there anything left over that i ca n't eat
[doctor] so yeah you can eat you know how about this how about we give you a a referral to a dietitian and they can help you with that

[patient] i said yeah too bad they did
[doctor] yeah alright well i wan na just go ahead and do a quick physical exam on you okay so you know looking at your vital signs here in the office you know your your blood pressure is about one thirty five over eighty so it's it's not too bad and maybe like to see it a little bit lower i'm just gon na be calling out my physical exam findings and i'm gon na let you know what they mean when i'm done okay so on your neck exam i appreciate some jugular venous distention up to about nine centimeters there are no carotid bruits on your lung exam i do appreciate bibasilar crackles with occasional rhonchi that clears when you cough on your heart exam i do appreciate a three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate one to two plus pitting edema bilaterally so frank what does that mean all that means is that you have findings on you that suggest that you're retaining fluid now we'll have to talk a little bit about how we're going to address that okay so i wan na just go over a little bit about my assessment and my plan for you okay so for the for your first problem of your shortness of breath i do believe you're having a an acute heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and increase your lasix from forty milligrams a day to eighty milligrams a day and i want you to call me in two days and let me know how your weight has been with increasing the diuretic now if you start to have worsening shortness of breath before that i want you to yeah call me we may have to admit you to the hospital for some intravenous diuretics okay i also wan na go ahead and just obtain
[patient] salt on lasix all at once am i take it all at once or do i divide it up
[doctor] how about you start taking the the increased dose in the morning and then we'll see how you do and if necessary i'll have to add a second dose in the afternoon that you can take around four o'clock in the afternoon i do n't want you to take it too late at night because then you will be going to the bathroom all night okay
[patient] that sounds correct
[doctor] so i also want to go ahead and order a chest x-ray just to make sure that we are not missing anything else okay for your second problem of your coronary artery disease you know it sounds like you're doing well except for this heart failure exacerbation so i wan na go ahead and order another echocardiogram to check out that heart murmur that i hear on your physical exam just to make sure that that's not getting any worse and to make sure that the pumping function of your heart is stable and i'm gon na go ahead and call doctor white and let them know that i want you to be seen by them okay okay and then for your third problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i want you to go ahead and try to you know do n't please do n't take anymore motrin or advil i do want you to try to stick with tylenol and if you're still having a significant problem with with some pain i want you to call me and we'll talk about some alternative medications that we can use or therapies okay i will also want to go ahead and order a complete metabolic panel just to make sure that your kidney function is stable does that sound okay
[patient] that sounds good do you have any idea what was going on with my foot pain before
[doctor] well how long have you been having it how long you've been having that foot pain
[patient] that's why i took the motrin it lasted you know four five days slowly went away
[doctor] it was in both of your feet
[patient] one
[doctor] one and where in your foot was was it
[patient] just in front of the big toe
[doctor] just in front of the big toe okay have you ever had a history of gout
[patient] nobody has told me about that
[doctor] okay alright well it sounds like it could've been gout you know with your chronic kidneys chronic kidney disease it it's a possibility so for this possible gout flare for your fourth problem of your possible gout flare let's go ahead i wan na just go ahead and order a uric acid just to see and it's something that we can talk about there is an alternative medication that you can take with your kidney function that that would n't hurt it that would n't injure it any further and i think it would work just the same
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay any other questions
[patient] just as long as you think i'm gon na get better
[doctor] i think you're gon na get better yes i think we're gon na you know i really want you to watch your salt intake and i'm gon na go ahead and order that dietary dietitian referral so that you can get your diet under control but you really have to watch your salt intake i think that that's kind of what this heart failure exacerbation is about maybe a little dietary indiscretion

[doctor] okay okay so we are gon na go ahead if it's okay with you and start your physical exam reviewing your vitals so vitals look good especially your oxygen especially with the chemotherapy you've been getting and the cough so your oxygen looks good so i'm happy with that so now i'm just examining your neck especially with your sore throat and i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy and also no supraclavicular adenopathy listening to your heart you have a nice regular rate and rhythm with no murmurs that i appreciate now on your lung exam when you're taking some deep breaths i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally and what that means is there is there is some faint sounds that i'm hearing which could represent some fluid there so on looking at your skin exam on your chest you do have some erythema on the anterior side of the chest on the left side and this could be related to the radiation so on your lower extremities i appreciate no edema and everything else looks good and thank you i know you did a chest x-ray before coming in so on your results for the chest x-ray it does look like you have some mild radiation pneumonitis which basically means some inflammation of the lungs most likely due to the radiation so what does this all mean so for your assessment and plan so for the first diagnosis the first problem of the lung cancer so what we're gon na do is we're gon na continue with the current regimen of your chemotherapy of the cisplatin and etoposide and the etoposide and we're gon na continue with your current dose of radiation at forty five gray and when that's complete we will repeat some imaging and hopefully you know the tumor will shrink down enough that we can remove it surgically okay for problem number two so the radiation pneumonitis so that's what causing that cough as well as some of the shortness of breath i know you're not experiencing it much now so what i'm gon na do for that is actually gon na prescribe you a low dose of prednisone and so that's an will help with the inflammation i'm gon na give you forty milligrams daily for five days and so hopefully that will help reduce the inflammation and so that you can continue with the radiation okay how does that sound so far
[patient] that sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay and then lastly for the painful swallowing that you're having so the inflammation you're having it not only in your lungs but it also in your esophagus as well so what i'm gon na do is prescribe you you're taking the the prednisone i'm also gon na give you a lidocaine swish and swallow and you can do that four times a day and so that will be able to help you so you can eat immediately after taking it and it can also help so that you can continue to take food and fluids prevent dehydration and any further weight loss
[patient] great
[doctor] okay any questions for me
[patient] i do n't believe so at this time
[doctor] okay alright so i'll see you at your next visit
[patient] great thank you

virtscribe_nan_VS002,"[doctor] patient's name is diana scott , date of birth 12/8/1920 . the date of service is 7/9/2021 . this is a new patient note . good afternoon . how are you today ? [patient] i'm good , thank you . [doctor] good . well , what brings you in to see me today ? [patient] well , my doctor says that i have a heart murmur . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do n't know how big a heart murmur i have or really even what it is . [doctor] okay so how long have you had that for ? do you have any idea or is that completely new as far as you know ? [patient] yeah , she said it's a new worrisome heart murmur , so of course i'm worried as well . [doctor] got it . okay . and are you having any symptoms at all ? [patient] i do n't think so . i do n't know what symptoms i should be having . [doctor] okay . well , so you are 100 , so we ca n't really get around that one , so i expect that you probably do n't move quite as fast as maybe you used to . [patient] no , i definitely do n't . [doctor] okay . and do you notice that you have any chest pain or feel shortness of breath ? [patient] no , i do n't have any chest pain . my problem is i have severe pains in my legs and so she had me go in for a chest x-ray and that was just last week . [doctor] okay . [patient] and so i started taking pain pills for my legs . [doctor] okay , got it for the legs and do you feel short of breath at all ? [patient] if i walk too fast or too long or if i try to drink a whole glass of water without stopping , then yeah , i do get short of breath that way . [doctor] okay and how far can you walk before you feel short of breath or sort of overly fatigued ? [patient] well i do have a walker now , so i do n't know , maybe when i walk to the end of the driveway or walk around the culvasec . [doctor] got it , alright . [patient] so it is n't that bothersome to me at all maybe more if i try to overdo it . [doctor] okay . [patient] then i i get short of breath if i do overdo it though . [doctor] okay , got it and so how different would you say that these symptoms are now compared to like 6 months ago or a year ago ? [patient] i would say probably 70 to 80 % from about 6 months ago . before that , i did n't notice anything at all . [doctor] okay . so do you feel like it's mainly the leg pain that seems to limit you ? [patient] my legs have been severe for about a month now . [doctor] okay and how about do you feel lightheaded or dizzy at all ? [patient] yeah , so i do take a pill for that when it does get bad . [doctor] okay . [patient] yeah , and i do n't take it everyday , only when i do feel dizzy . [doctor] okay , and so how about any passing out at all ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , good . and how about irregular heart beats , do you ever feel like your heart is going too fast or like it skips a beat ? [patient] i do n't notice it at all . [doctor] okay , great and how about any swelling in the legs at all ? [patient] yeah , my ankles swell . [doctor] okay , and how long has this been going on ? [patient] i would say for probably 6 months , but it goes up and down and sometimes it's worse than other times . [doctor] okay and how about any recent weight gain or anything else like that ? [patient] i lost a little bit of weight , but i still weigh 120 pounds , but i normally weigh about 130 pounds . [doctor] mm-hmm okay . [patient] but that's been going down gradually for about a year . [doctor] okay and then how about any fevers , chills , or anything else that's going on that you can think of ? [patient] no . [doctor] good . so mainly it sounds like you came in mostly because of the murmur , is that right and sort of just kinda seeing what things look like ? [patient] yeah , that and i feel overly tired because i take all that medication . [doctor] okay . and so fatigue as well and have you ever had any testing of your heart done ? [patient] i'm not really sure . [doctor] okay . it does look like you've had a decent number of surgeries here uh ? [patient] yeah , you name it . [doctor] alright , well , i will make you repeat them since i do you have a good record ? but just give me just a second and i'm going to enter the ones we need , okay ? alright got them and then are you taking all the medicines that you went through with madison ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay , good and looking at your family history , looks like maybe your brother had a heart attack , is that correct ? [patient] it was actually my son , not my brother . [doctor] okay , i'll make that adjustment . [patient] but my brother did have a stroke , but that was because he had gotten sugar diabetes and my older sister did have a heart problem as well . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] yeah , so heart problems kinda run in the family . [doctor] okay . alright , well , it looks like also that you've never smoked , that's excellent and then no allergies to medicines that you know of , is that correct ? [patient] correct . [doctor] alright , well let's do a quick exam . [patient] alright , sounds good . [doctor] alright , well , for physical exam , please use the regular template . alright , please just breathe normally . great and now take a few deep breaths for me alright . do you feel okay , are you feeling any dizziness or anything ? [patient] no , i feel fine . [doctor] okay , great . alright , well that is it for the exam . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so what i'm thinking is let's go ahead and schedule you for an echocardiogram . it's a very common test and it just takes a picture of your heart and it'll let me see how well your heart is actually working . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i can order that for today . do you have time to complete that ? it should n't take too long . [patient] yes , that's fine . i have time . [doctor] okay , great . so we will complete that today to oversess your overall cardiac structure and function as well as the valvular disease . [patient] okay . [doctor] and some possible outcomes and what we might suggest to fix it . i'll , i'll go over that . so one possible suspicion i'm having is it's called aortic stenosis and that just means that one of your main valves of your heart has narrowed a bit and the valve does n't really open quite fully and this could just reduce or block the blood flow from your heart into the main artery of your body and that's called the aorta into the rest of your body . [patient] okay . [doctor] and if this is severe , then we might wan na perform a procedure called the transcatheter aortic valve replacement or we wrote just called it tavr and it is a minimally invasive procedure to replace the valve . [patient] well i would have to think about that . i , i'm not too sure i want to do that given my age at all . [doctor] yeah , sure , no problem and we do n't have to make any decisions today just you know wanted to go over a couple of these things . but sometimes we can also perform a surgical aortic valve replacement or it's called an sa vr but really because of your age and medical history unfortunately that would n't be a good option for you . [patient] i see . okay , well i guess we'll see what you see from , from the test . [doctor] yeah , agree . okay . and so couple other things real quick . so it looked like your blood pressure looked really good today . so we are not going to change your amlodipine or lisinopril so just continue taking those as you are currently . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] and then it also looks like you are taking about 20 mg of simvastatin for your lipids . and i will defer to your pcp , however , given you are having leg pain in both your legs and given your age and no history of coronary artery disease , it is possible that you might be able to stop your statin . [patient] really ? [doctor] yeah possibly he would have to evaluate you but it is certainly something to discuss with him so i will send over the results of the echocardiogram and also my recommendations and then you guys can talk about the statin . [patient] okay , that sounds great . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome and then lastly your hypothyroidism , i see you're taking the levothyroxine and again no change here and you can just keep taking that as you have been . [patient] okay , i will . [doctor] alright . so we will see you back here in about 3 to 4 weeks to discuss the results and your next steps and we'll take care of your echocardiogram today . any questions ? [patient] not that i can think of . thank you so much . i think i will sweat . [doctor] okay , awesome . alright . well , have a good rest of your day and we will see you soon . for physical exam , constitutional , elderly , otherwise no acute distress . cardiovascular normal . s1 and s2 is preserved with a normal rate and regular rhythm . there is a 4 out of 6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids . neurologic , gait is normal for age . for assessment and plan , probably one cardiac murmur , diana has a 4-6 systolic murmur at the upper right sternal border with mild radiation to the keratids . this is most likely representative of aortic stenosis . her symptoms could be due to severe aortic aortic stenosis , however , her s2 is relatively preserved , which would be more consistent with consistent with moderate . some of her outside records do note diastolic dysfunction , so it is possible she , she did have an echocardiogram at some point in the past . she does not appear significantly volume overloaded today . her next problem is pvcs . her referral mentioned tachycardia . her ekg today shows sinus rhythm with frequent pvcs . as well as an anterior septum infarct pattern . she does not have any significant palpitations and we will check an echocardiogram to assess over overall cardiac structure and function . depending on results as well as the severity of her aortic stenosis , we will need to consider an ischemic evaluation or further possibly a heart monitor to assess overall burden of the pvcs . at this point , she is asymptomatic , so we will start with the echocardiogram only . her next problem , hyperlipidemia is managed by her pcp due to bilateral leg pain over the last month , consider tavr evaluation following echocardiogram . could be indicated and next problem , lightheadedness , dizziness . she is on meclizine for this . it is possible that some of her lightheadedness and dizziness is related to the aorta stenosis and we will do an echocardiogram as noted above . pvcs on her ekg could be contributing but she does not feel palpitations . we will consider a monitor but start with the echocardiogram first as noted above . follow up 3 to 4 weeks after her echocardiogram is done to discuss results and next steps . end of dictation .","S (Subjective):

The patient reports weight loss from about 130 pounds to 120 pounds.

The patient reports that her weight has been gradually decreasing for about a year.

The patient denies fevers or chills.

The patient feels overly tired and attributes this to taking a lot of medication.

The patient has had a large number of surgeries in the past.

The patient is taking all the medicines previously reviewed with another provider.

The patient’s son had a heart attack.

The patient’s brother had a stroke.

The patient’s brother had diabetes.

The patient’s older sister had a heart problem.

The patient reports that heart problems run in her family.

The patient has never smoked.

The patient has no known medication allergies.

On physical exam the patient is elderly and in no acute distress.

On cardiovascular exam the patient has normal S1 and S2 with a normal rate and regular rhythm.

On cardiovascular exam there is a 4/6 systolic murmur at the right upper sternal border with mild radiation to the carotids.

On neurologic exam the patient’s gait is normal for age.

The clinician’s assessment is that the systolic murmur is most likely representative of aortic stenosis.

The clinician notes that the patient’s symptoms could be due to severe aortic stenosis.

The clinician notes that the relatively preserved S2 is more consistent with moderate aortic stenosis.

Outside records note diastolic dysfunction.

The clinician notes that the patient does not appear significantly volume overloaded.

The patient’s referral mentioned tachycardia.

The patient’s EKG shows sinus rhythm with frequent premature ventricular contractions.

The patient’s EKG shows an anterior septal infarct pattern.

The patient does not have significant palpitations.

The patient has hyperlipidemia managed by her primary care provider.

The patient has bilateral leg pain over the last month.

The patient has lightheadedness and dizziness.

The patient is taking meclizine for lightheadedness and dizziness.

The clinician considers that premature ventricular contractions on EKG could be contributing to lightheadedness and dizziness.

The patient is taking amlodipine.

The patient is taking lisinopril.

The patient’s blood pressure was good at this visit.

The plan is to continue amlodipine without change.

The plan is to continue lisinopril without change.

The patient is taking 20 mg of simvastatin for lipids.

The clinician notes that the patient has no history of coronary artery disease.

The clinician suggests that the patient might be able to stop her statin and that this should be evaluated by her primary care provider.

The clinician will send the echocardiogram results and recommendations to the patient’s primary care provider.

The patient has hypothyroidism.

The patient is taking levothyroxine for hypothyroidism.

The plan is to continue levothyroxine without change.

The clinician plans an echocardiogram to assess overall cardiac structure and function.

The echocardiogram is also intended to assess valvular disease.

The echocardiogram will be completed on the same day as the visit.

The clinician suspects possible aortic stenosis as the cause of the murmur.

The clinician explains that aortic stenosis involves narrowing of a main heart valve that reduces or blocks blood flow from the heart into the aorta.

If aortic stenosis is severe, the clinician may consider transcatheter aortic valve replacement.

The clinician states that surgical aortic valve replacement would not be a good option for the patient because of her age and medical history.

The clinician plans to consider a transcatheter aortic valve replacement evaluation following the echocardiogram.

The clinician plans to consider an ischemic evaluation depending on echocardiogram results and severity of aortic stenosis.

The clinician plans to consider a heart monitor to assess the burden of premature ventricular contractions depending on echocardiogram results.

Because the patient is currently asymptomatic from premature ventricular contractions, the clinician will start with an echocardiogram only.

The clinician plans follow-up in 3 to 4 weeks after the echocardiogram to discuss results and next steps."

[doctor] we are okay , thank you . [patient_guest] that's good to hear . so how many days has randy been feeling sick ? [doctor] well i would say it started around suppertime last night . [patient_guest] last night , okay and what's been going on ? [doctor] well , he started to get a runny nose . [patient_guest] okay , does he stuffy too ? [doctor] yeah , yeah . [patient_guest] and have you noticed , is his mucus clear right now ? [doctor] it is , it is right now , yes . [patient_guest] pain , does he also have a cough ? [doctor] yes , but it's not barky . [patient_guest] and does he act like he has a sore throat or is he pulling on his ears ? [doctor] well , i know he has been pulling on his ears , yeah . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] you know he also , he has also been going crazy rubbing at his nose too . [patient_guest] okay and any fever you've noticed ? [doctor] i checked his rectal temperature and it was 100.3 . [patient_guest] okay , so little bit of a low grade fever there definitely and how was his appetite ? did he eat last night ? [doctor] yes , he did , yeah . [patient_guest] and how about this morning , did he eat his breakfast ? [doctor] this morning he ate about 7 ounces from the bottle . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] and then he got another bottle and he barely ate that . i offered him cereal and he would n't eat that either . [patient_guest] okay . [doctor] so he varies i guess . [patient_guest] how is his energy ? does he seem like he wants to take more naps or does he have pretty good energy ? [doctor] it seems like he is irritable . [patient_guest] irritable because he is n't feeling good . [doctor] yeah he is energetic but it seems like he ca n't go to sleep like he is fighting it really hard . [patient_guest] okay just for the chart , is there anyone anybody else exposed to them who has been sick ? [doctor] yes , his older sister has been sick . [patient_guest] thank you . [doctor] we also had a date with my nephew who i learned later had a sinus infection . [patient_guest] and what medications have you tried for him , anything at all ? [doctor] i've been doing the saline mist in his nose . [patient_guest] good , that's a , a good choice . [doctor] i did give him tylenol really early this morning because he was warm when i took the sleeper off of him . [patient_guest] and we have the ac on in the house , but his whole body was sweating . [doctor] i see and any other medications ? [patient_guest] we did put some baby vicks on his feet last night to try and help him breathe and i also used the humidifier . okay , that's good . [doctor] okay , okay . [patient_guest] so there was another thing i wanted to bring up since we're here , it appears that his cradle cap has gotten a little worse , what are you using on it ? [doctor] i've been using the cradle cap brush and then i use regular aveeno shampoo . [patient_guest] is it a dandruff shampoo ? [doctor] no , i do n't think so . [patient_guest] okay , thank you . well , let's complete his exam and then we will talk about the next steps . [doctor] okay , sounds good . [patient_guest] can you take a big breath , randy , [doctor] where is mama ? [patient_guest] do n't forget to breathe , little one , [doctor] okay , let's try the front too . yeah , it's okay buddy . [patient_guest] excellent , he is doing excellent . next let's let's check out those ears . [doctor] okay . let's try to make sure you do n't tip all the way over . diane you're doing so good . alright , ears look okay . we are going to slide you forward so you do n't bump your head when i lay you down . hey you're , hey , you're okay , you're okay . [patient_guest] okay , you can go ahead and sit him back up if you like . [doctor] alright , thank you . [patient_guest] alright so he is just kind of getting started with this and i think we are seeing something viral right now . often sinus infections will start out as a virus and then will become bacterial infections if left alone and does n't go away but i do n't think he needs any antibiotics at least not at this point in time . keep up with the fluids , rest and i would watch him very carefully for a barking cough . if he does get a barky cough , then that tends to be a little bit more significant , a little more severe . so if he develops a barky cough , i want you to give him a half a teaspoon of his sister's medicine , you know i'm almost tempted to give you some of the medicine because they're probably sharing the same virus . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] actually i will , i'll go ahead and just give you some as well . [doctor] okay , okay . [patient_guest] but if he does n't become barky , you do n't have to use it , it only works for the barky cough . [doctor] hmmm got it . [patient_guest] okay and we will do the same thing with him as long as nothing gets worse and we will see him back in 1 week so it wo n't get rid of a regular cough . he can use zarbee's but use the dose for kids under a year of age . so if you wan na get some of that , you can definitely try that for him . it can help out a little bit with the regular cough . [doctor] i do have a question . do you or do you not give honey to babies ? yes , that's a great question . you do n't give honey to kids under a year . instead , you can give them a gave which is a different type of nectar . [patient_guest] now you can give honey to his older sister , that is okay , but for him it would not be very good because the stomach acid is not good enough to break down the botulism spores , so it would cause him harm . you should look at the package of say honey nut cheerios it says right on there to not give it to a baby . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] now whether that would really hurt a baby , i am unsure but it has real honey in it , so no honey for him , but a gave a is definitely fine . okay . [doctor] so zarbee's for the stuffy nose . [patient_guest] yes , zarbee's . [doctor] and then you said which medicine to give him just in case ? [patient_guest] i'm gon na give him the same medicine as his sister and just hang on to it just to watch and see . if this was a monday and we had a whole week to watch , i would say to just call us if things got worse , but since if it's gon na be the weekend and things might worsen tonight or tomorrow , i , i would rather you have just what you need on hand . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] right and does that make sense ? [doctor] yeah , yeah , that makes sense . [patient_guest] okay , great , and that way you do n't have to share with his sister . [doctor] right , okay . [patient_guest] and since he is about half her size , we will do half the dose , which is a half a teaspoon . [doctor] okay . will this information all be in the papers ? [patient_guest] yes and so if he ends up starting the medicine , just give him a half a teaspoon for 5 days . [doctor] okay . [patient_guest] yeah , that's the only thing it wo n't say is as needed or anything like that . [doctor] hmmm understood . thank you . [patient_guest] you're welcome . [doctor] and the cradle cap . [patient_guest] what i would do is use something like either head and shoulders or selsun blue or nizoral a.d. and i do n't get the extra strength stuff , just use the regular strength . krano cap , it's just basically a fancy way of saying dandruff , so those shampoos will help get rid of it . it's not an immediate thing because they they are all dead scales and you still have to brush them off , so continue to use the soft brush and some baby oil or something that will help get the scales out and those shampoos will actually help to prevent it as well . use it two times per week , not everyday but maybe twice a week , so 2 days between shampooing , use what you normally use any other time . and then often within 6 weeks or so , you will notice that the the cradle cap is just not coming back anymore , but you have to be careful because it's not ph balanced for eyes , so just make sure when you're rinsing his hair , you avoid his eyes . [doctor] okay okay . [patient_guest] alright and if it keeps getting worse , definitely let us know . [doctor] okay sounds good . [patient_guest] good and since they do n't have covid-19 , you can go right ahead and check out . [doctor] okay and both appointments in a week . [patient_guest] correct . we'll see you all then . bye randy , feel better . [doctor] alright , great . thank you so much . [patient_guest] you are welcome and have a good rest of your day .","S (Subjective):

[patient] okay , that's reassuring . yeah , so what i wan na do first is just get a little bit of history about the sort of symptoms that you're having and then i'll do a quick exam . okay . that sounds good . and then we will talk more about the surgery and what it entails and at this point who is your insurance provider ? actually my husband just accepted a new job and i will be on his plan which i believe is not going to be blue cross , but it may be changing . [doctor] okay . what we typically do when we do a breast reduction consult , [patient] document your symptoms , symptoms , we will take some pictures , then they get sent to the insurance company and what they will do is decide whether it's approved or medically necessary or not but we want to make sure we send it to the right insurance . do you know when you will be on the new plan ? mostly july . okay , so we may just wait until july to submit for approval at that time . okay . [doctor] so regarding your symptoms , do you experience back pain ? [patient] well , i've been going to the chiropractor for a few years . [doctor] pain here and here not painful.when i'm walking at my desk all day . [patient] okay and in your neck and your upper back and how long has this been going on would you say 5 years , 10 years or even since puberty ? i would say since i was in high school . okay and do you have the bra strap indentations in your shoulders i saw that you're wearing about a g cup . [doctor] patient regular wellbe therapy more comfortable and that is extensive than . [patient] yeah , i have heard that as well and have you had any children , are you planning to have any children in the future ? no , i do not have any kids now but we might plan to in the future . okay and at this time , are you experiencing any numbness or tingling in the , in the hands or any nipple pain ? sometimes , yes . okay and rashes , do you get any rashes underneath your breasts and , and it could be from sweating ? no , but they are always sweaty . okay and then do you feel like your activities are limited because of the size ? there are certain things i do when i have to hold them like working out and any jumping or running and it hurts . and it hurts , okay and , and you saw a chiropractor , but what about physical therapy for your back pain or do you take any pain medicine for it ? no , but i do take a migraine medication , propranolol . that's okay . so let's see , i know that you have a history of breast cancer in your family . have you had any mammograms and how old was your mother when she had it ? mom was 40 and they recommended me starting at age 30 for mammogram . i'm still , i mean i'm 25 , so i'm still a little bit young . [doctor] okay , and otherwise it seems like you're really healthy . [patient] yes for the most part . i lost about 10 pounds over the past few months and i still would like to lose about 20 more pounds . congratulations , that's great and then you're welcome and so do you use any tobacco , drugs or alcohol and then you said that you were going to school , what are you going to school for ? i drink a little wine on occasion and for school , i'm currently setting psychology . [doctor] okay , that's great . alright , so what we will do is we will go ahead and take a look . i'm going to take a couple of measurements and we will kinda talk about the surgery afterwards . so go ahead and stand up for me julia . [patient] okay , so looking at the measurements , it looks like one breast is a little lower than the other , yeah . okay . well , thank you so much . it looks like i have all the measurements that we need . you can go ahead and cover up now . okay . [doctor] so i think you are a great candidate for a breast reduction . when we talk about a breast reduction , what happens is that we remove the tissue out of the breast . [patient] okay , that's fine . and we would then lift them and elevate the nipple position in order to help with your back pain , neck pain and because i'm a plastic surgeon , of course i want them to look nice as well . wow . [doctor] so typically when you do the breast reduction , we make an incision around the nipple straight down and then underneath and it kinda looks like an anchor below . [patient] then straight down and underneath and through that incision , we're able to to lift the breast and we'll take off any extra fat and brush breast tissue , so that way it becomes smaller in size . and i noticed that you would like to be a b cup , so i do tell every patient , we can make you a small as your blood supply allows and what that means is we must move the nipple without cutting off any of it's blood supply during the surgery . okay . well , thank you for explaining that . you're welcome . and in your case , you'll probably be a small c a b cup might be a little bit small , but we'll see once i'm doing the , the procedure for you . okay . [doctor] and typically the surgery takes about 3 hours you will have drains one in each side and that helps prevent fluid from building up in the breast and that stays in for about a week and then we will remove them in the clinic . [patient] and you'll have a clear plastic tape over your incision that should help with the scars and we've seen that patients who have lighter skin , the scars will tend to be red at first and then it takes about a year for a scar to mature in line . okay . well i'm not too worried about the card . okay and i do like to keep patients overnight , it's just going to be for one night in the hospital , [doctor] and we just wan na make sure your pain is controlled , make sure you're not nauseated , all of that stuff . some patients wan na go home that same day , [patient] but you know that some people get nauseated and the last thing that i want is for you to be vomiting at home alone without the , the support here at the facility . okay . yeah , that sounds good . okay . and then about 30 % of patients say that they can not breast feed after a breast reduction and the reason is the breast is made up of fat and it's also made up of a gland and the gland is what produces the milk , okay . and so in order to reduce the size of the breast , we have to take out both the fat and the glands , so it just depends on how much is left , whether you can breast-feed in the future and then also the breast will change over time if you gain weight , they will get larger , things like that . yeah , okay . and if you have children they will change as well . they will enlarge especially if you can breast feed , but they will go back down will appear a little bit deflated . yeah i do n't know if i'm interested in breast feeding . okay the hormones of pregnancy though will change the breast , so that's just something to be aware of and i tell all younger patients that . okay , yeah , absolutely . and then typically nipple sensation is fine after a breast reduction , but there is a slight chance that you will have an alteration in the nipple sensation or not have any sensation in the nipple , generally the nipple is just fine unless it is a massive reduction and it's quite normal after surgery to be a little bit bruised and then it just takes some time for that to go away . yeah , okay . but other than that you know most patients are very happy after the breast reduction because of the symptoms of the back pain , the neck pain , you can feel relief almost immediately . so do you have any questions julia about the process or anything like that ? no , not really . [doctor] okay and , and i do think you are a good candidate for it and i think you will benefit from it as well . [patient] good . i look forward to the release . i think you just have to do it when you are ready when you know that you feel like it's a good time because it is a commitment and you will have some activity restrictions for about 6 weeks after surgery and no heavy lifting and i do say no driving for 2 to 3 weeks and the drain stay in like i said for about a week . okay well i am ready as soon as my insurance is switched over . okay . well i think from this point if you want to , we can take photos today while you're here . i have all the documentation now and the note about your symptoms and that's what the insurance company is going to look for , so thank you for answering those questions . so once we have the new provider , we'll go ahead and get that submitted and then when they approve it , what the office will do is they'll work with you on a surgery date and then we'll meet again right before the surgery to answer any last minute questions . [doctor] and go over the instructions in more detail and things like that . [patient] okay . well , i will notify the office as soon as i have the insurance information . that sounds great and then we can get it all in process and it was so nice to meet you and catherine will be right in to get your photos . julia jones is a 25-year-old female with symptomatic macromycinia presenting for evaluation of breast reduction . the patient has attempted nonsurgical treatments with minimal relief and is an ideal candidate for bilateral reduction mammoplasty . her minimum required resection based on a bsa of 2.65 with the schnur scale is 1792 g which should be attainable . given her extremely large breasts and the measurements above , there is potential for using a free nipple graft . physical exam findings of breast . inspection reveals asymmetrical breasts with severe ptosis bilaterally .

[patient] yes ma'am . [doctor] well , it looks like you have 1 stone in the left kidney , but it's not obstructing anything . [patient] i knew it had to be a kidney stone . i passed what looked like two small stones last week after i scheduled this appointment and then for the past 6 weeks , i've had a few episodes of bright red urine , the color of like cherry cholestee , and last week i was constantly having to pee , and it hurt something terrible . [doctor] how bad was your pain on a scale of 0-10 , zero being no pain and 10 being worst as you can imagine . [patient] at the time i'd say an eight . [doctor] are you having any flank pain now or tenderness in your lower back ? [patient] no , after passing those stones , things have felt a lot better . [doctor] that's good to hear . now , it looks like you're only taking alavert 10 mg a day and have no drug allergies . is that correct ? [patient] that's right . [doctor] alright , well let's take a look at you today . let's use my default pe . well mrs. wood , we know that the blood in your urine was due to the kidney stones . fortunately you passed two last week and the blood has nearly subsided . you do still have 1 stone in the left kidney . since it's not obstructing or causing pain , i do n't recommend any surgical intervention at this time . [patient] i would like to know what i can do to stop getting these stones . [doctor] as we discussed last time , the formation of kidney stones can not be attributed to a particular cause . but several factors increase the risk such as dehydration , family history , certain foods , digestive tract disease , and certain medical conditions . [patient] yeah i know i do n't drink near the amount of water that i should . i drink more mountain dew than anything . [doctor] you should drink about half of your body weight in ounces of water a day . [patient] so if i weigh 250 pounds , i should drink . [doctor] that would be 125 ounces of water a day and you should avoid drinking sugary drinks like mountain dew . [patient] okay . is there any food i should n't eat ? [doctor] great question . you should avoid food rich in sodium , oxalate , and animal protein . so that would be salty , processed foods because they are high in sodium . ideally you should consume less than 1000 mg of sodium a day and reduce the amount of beef , poultry , fish , and pork . [patient] what's oxalate ? [doctor] it's an organic acid found in plants that when digested , it binds to minerals that stones are formed from foods like spinach , chocolate , beets , rubar , and soy products . [patient] well , i'll do whatever it takes to try to avoid getting these stones again . [doctor] great and here is a handout that you can look over . it goes over the dietary recommendations and what to avoid . [patient] okay , good . i like to have things in writing to help you remember . [doctor] perfect . well , if you have any more questions , if you do n't have any more questions , you're all set , i wo n't need to see you back until next year as long as you do n't have any more issues like bleeding or pain . if you do have any issues , you can always call the office sooner and if you experience any severe pain or bright red blood in your urine , you should go to the emergency room .

[patient] so i've always had a little bit issues but this is it's does n't feel like it's in the rotator cuff it's it's kinda more on the outside and it's kinda like it's more tender on the outside when i raise my arm up so
[doctor] okay yeah are you able to move your arm very well or not
[patient] yeah there is no restriction with my arm it just i definitely feel some pain on the outside of it
[doctor] okay and are you having pain all the time or just or does it come and go
[patient] just whenever i move it if i'm sitting still i really do n't notice anything but whenever i move it then i can definitely feel some pain
[doctor] okay how about at night is it bothering you at night also
[patient] a little bit because i sleep on that side so
[doctor] okay
[patient] of course
[doctor] okay and i may miss did you say what have you been taking for pain for that
[patient] i just been taking some advil and then icing as much as i can so that's about it
[doctor] okay and does that seem to help or
[patient] a little bit yeah a little bit i mean it's it's still like you know sore to touch but it definitely dulls it a little bit
[doctor] well sounds like you have quite a few projects going on what all what all are you doing for for your yard and
[patient] i well let's see i've been putting an outdoor shower in we're extending our patio putting making some flower boxes putting down some you know for stone and all the flower beds so my wife's really put me to work i got a laundry lift
[doctor] wow it sounds like a variety of projects but if you're putting down stone you're probably lifting those as well and then
[patient] yeah
[doctor] yeah i bet that is sore now tell me this have you experienced any numbness in your arm or your hands or
[patient] no not really no numbness that i can think of
[doctor] okay alright so see i'm gon na i'd like to do just a quick physical exam and i've reviewed your vitals those look good your no fever so that's good you're ninety seven . eight and your heart rate looks good at sixty two respirations sixteen your blood pressures one sixteen over eighty four that looks fine your oxygen saturation is real good at ninety nine percent so that all looks good so let's take a look at your left at your right shoulder so you have limited active and passive range of motion and there is some tenderness at the great tuberosity of the humerus there is no tenderness at the sternoclavicular or acro acromioclavicular joints you do have a good hand grip okay and on neurovascular exam of your right arm your capillary refill is less than three seconds and your sensation to touch is intact so i've reviewed the results of your shoulder x-ray and there is no fracture so that's good so let me tell you a little bit about my assessment and plan so for your first problem the right shoulder pain your symptoms are most likely due to this rotator cuff rotator cuff tendinopathy that means you that you injured injured the tendons of the muscles that help make your shoulder muscles i think we had to go ahead and order just an mri since you have had some problems before as well to make sure there's nothing else going on with it and i also want to refer you to physical therapy for approximately six to eight weeks and so during that time continue the tylenol and if your symptoms do n't improve we can go ahead and consider a steroid injection of your shoulder which could provide some relief do you have any questions about your plan
[patient] no that sounds good
[doctor] okay alright yeah a lot of patients it's very successful with the physical therapy so i really hope that will do it and so we'll just start there okay
[patient] sounds great
[doctor] okay thanks
[patient] thanks
[doctor] did you have any other any other problems any other injuries that that went along with this or
[patient] my both my my feet are actually really sore too i obviously have been doing a lot of other yard work so you know it's kinda it's really stiff and stuff and they you know my ankle joints as well my wife seems to think that i do n't drink enough water so it could be something along that lines but i do n't know they're kinda this they just they're really sore and stuff so i've been trying to put them up and kinda put ice on them keep them elevated and it seems to be helping out a little bit but
[doctor] yeah so if you do n't feel that you did anything to injure it we might start just maybe do some epsom salts have you tried soaking your feet in epsom salts that will tend to kinda pull out what's going on in there and just help your those muscles to relax and the soreness to to go away you might try that

virtscribe_nan_VS001,"[doctor] alright new patient jordan roberts date of birth 3/2/1972 . he is a 49-year-old with hypertension and palpitations please copy forward his thyroid profile from march 1 , 2021 mr. roberts doing today i'm fine thank you good so i saw you were recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and some palpitations yeah that was back in march i think but my girlfriend and i we talked about it and on that day i had a few cups of coffee and no breakfast so i think it was probably more of a panic attack than anything else since so tell me about the blood pressure issues my blood pressure since i was young family history of this family does have high blood pressure i see . [patient] yeah i thought i was getting better and have a new primary doctor and she put me on a new medication about a month ago . [doctor] can you tell me which medications you are taking ? [patient] my new med is a combo med something 4025 . [doctor] okay yes this is at your chart the benicar hct it has hydrochlorothiazide in it yet that sent my water pill i call it okay are you still taking the amlodipine 10 mg daily yes i am . [patient] that's that's a good start regimen are you checking your blood pressure at home and if yes what numbers are you seeing ? [doctor] every day . [patient] awesome . [doctor] yeah every morning i take it when i get up and been running about 1:46 to 1:55 lately . not down in the 120s yet no not yet while we are trying to get there though okay how are you doing with your salt intake charted back off of it i think i'm doing good with it not eating too much good i play huge part in lowering your pressure and staying away from salt is important information on the–eating plan which is the only eating plan that has been shown to lower blood pressure sounds good are you doing any exercise i do try and walk on the treadmill when i can okay great so let's take a look throughout your exam just like you make sure i get everything documented okay . please use my general physical exam template let me take a listen to you and make sure everything sounds good . [patient] alright . [doctor] your heart and lungs sound good so that's great . [patient] good to hear . [doctor] alright go ahead and lie down and let me know if anywhere i press hurts . no , nowhere . alright , so i'm gon na take a look at your ankles and feet . i'm just gon na look for some swelling . [patient] alright . [doctor] so in terms of getting that pressure down you're on three meds that are maxed out and your blood pressure is still not down and the question is what do we need to do to get your . [patient] to get it down . your potassium 1 week ago was 4.0 has it been redone since in the last week ? [doctor] no . okay for is good for your potassium level some people have what is called resistant hypertension that is driven by something else in the body often it is a form response if i were to take 10 people under the age of 50 who have high blood pressure who developed it at a young age 8 out of 10 would respond to reduce salt in their diet with a lower blood pressure but for the 2 out of 10 there is something else driving parathyroid levels or something called your adrenal glands over produce aldosterone which we call hyperaldosterone okay so is there is something we can do about it in these cases there is medicine called spironolactone that is very effective at dropping the aldosterone level and your blood pressure and i think we should give that a try i mean i'm willing to give it a try okay so lets discuss the piss of the possible risks of being on hydrochlorothiazide thiazide which is the fluid meds that you're now on and the spironolactone one issue is that they can affect your electrolyte balance they can also cause dehydration so when as you got to make sure that you hydrate you do not hydrate and you get dehydrated you will know it because you will get dizzy standing up second thing is this spironolactone can raise your potassium too far is rare but it can you're starting with your potassium at four so that gives us some room to feel a bit better and then the third thing is that spironolactone combined with hydrochlorothiazide chlorothiazide can cause your sodium levels to go down now this does not meet mean that you need to be eating more salt okay but it does mean that you will need to do blood test in 2 weeks to make sure that it's okay . alright that i can do are there any other side effects i need to worry about ? [patient] dizziness possibly as well as one in 100 guys might develop . [doctor] tenderness in the chest swollen breasts are enlarged breast this is a rare side effect called gynecomastia and if it happens you just cut the medication and you let me know but it is very uncommon . [patient] i'll definitely let you know that happens okay we'll keep working at it until your blood pressure gets better it can be tricky and your blood pressure starts to go up at a young age . [doctor] though it is important to get it under control because it can lead to your heart getting bigger or enlarged same thing that happens when you lift weights and your muscles get bigger and if your heart pumps against high blood pressure can eventually lead to heart failure . [patient] i understand . [doctor] yes of getting that under control is really important to help prevent kidney failure strokes and things like that that you are at high risk for with high blood pressure okay . the american heart association has a website called heart.it has a lot of really good information about blood pressure to teach to teach you about it and how to control your diet with exercise treadmill routinely for 30 minutes or so most days that could be 7-10 points of your blood pressure really relieve gait is very important to be active lower your salt and increase your potassium the goal is to keep your salt under 2000 mg a day the actual recommendation is is 1500 mg/day but most people have a hard time with that so just take a look at the website and the–diet information that will give you a lot of tips and information to help you start learning stuff i'll definitely check that out so we will try the spironolactone and schedule follow-up in 2 weeks to check your blood pressure and electrolytes if the new med does n't work the next step is going to be the resistant hypertension clinic so there they we'll look into secondary causes of your hypertension they have access to newer procedure-based technologies that can lower your blood pressure without medication for example there is something called a renal denervation where they go inside the artery that feeds your kidney with almost like a little coil and heat that artery up when they do that they can block the nerve endings that get into your kidneys and lower your blood pressure . that's interesting . [patient] yeah , so that procedure has been shown to lower blood pressure by 10 points there are of course some risks , so not everyone is a candidate but we will cross that road when we need to and let's just . [doctor] medication risper we will see you in 2 weeks then sounds good thanks doc you're welcome any questions we'll do . [patient] have a great day mr. roberts . [doctor] you too . [patient] mr. roberts presents with resistant hypertension he is on three meds and maximum dose . [doctor] i have added spironolactone to his regimen . we will need to monitor his potassium and sodium . he'll have a basic metabolic panel and blood pressure check in 2 weeks . next medication would be carvedilol which i have tried to avoid given its potential for erectile dysfunction i have talked to the patient about that and the potential side effects of spironolactone including the gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances if he is not controlled on spironolactone the next step would be sending him to resistant hypertension clinic .","S (Subjective):

The patient has hypertension.

The patient has experienced palpitations.

The patient was recently in the emergency room with high blood pressure and palpitations.

The patient believes the emergency room episode may have been a panic attack related to drinking a few cups of coffee and skipping breakfast.

The patient reports having high blood pressure since he was young.

The patient has a family history of high blood pressure.

The patient has a new primary care doctor.

About a month ago, the new primary care doctor started the patient on a new blood pressure medication.

The patient is taking a combination medication identified as Benicar HCT.

Benicar HCT contains hydrochlorothiazide.

The patient refers to hydrochlorothiazide as his water pill.

The patient is taking amlodipine 10 mg daily.

The patient checks his blood pressure at home every day.

The patient measures his blood pressure every morning when he gets up.

The patient reports recent home blood pressure readings around 146 to 155 systolic.

The patient’s blood pressure is not yet in the 120s systolic.

The patient has reduced his salt intake.

The patient believes he is doing well with not eating too much salt.

The patient tries to walk on the treadmill when he can.

On physical examination, the patient’s heart sounds are normal.

On physical examination, the patient’s lung sounds are normal.

On physical examination, the patient reports no abdominal tenderness when the doctor presses.

The doctor examined the patient’s ankles and feet for swelling.

The patient is on three blood pressure medications at maximum doses.

The patient’s blood pressure remains uncontrolled despite being on three maximum-dose medications.

The patient’s potassium level one week ago was 4.0.

The patient’s potassium level has not been rechecked in the last week.

The doctor considers that the patient may have resistant hypertension.

The doctor explained that some cases of resistant hypertension are driven by excess aldosterone production from the adrenal glands.

The doctor recommended starting spironolactone to lower aldosterone and blood pressure.

The patient is willing to try spironolactone.

The doctor explained that hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can affect electrolyte balance.

The doctor explained that hydrochlorothiazide and spironolactone can cause dehydration.

The doctor advised the patient to maintain adequate hydration while on these medications.

The doctor explained that dehydration from these medications can cause dizziness when standing up.

The doctor explained that spironolactone can rarely raise potassium too high.

The doctor noted that starting potassium of 4.0 provides some safety margin for spironolactone.

The doctor explained that spironolactone combined with hydrochlorothiazide can cause sodium levels to decrease.

The doctor stated that a decrease in sodium from these medications does not mean the patient should eat more salt.

The doctor stated that the patient will need blood tests in two weeks to check electrolytes.

The doctor discussed dizziness as a possible side effect of spironolactone.

The doctor explained that about 1 in 100 men on spironolactone might develop breast tenderness or swollen or enlarged breasts.

The doctor identified gynecomastia as a rare side effect of spironolactone.

The doctor instructed the patient to stop spironolactone and notify him if gynecomastia occurs.

The doctor explained that uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the heart to become enlarged.

The doctor explained that long-term pumping against high blood pressure can eventually lead to heart failure.

The doctor explained that controlling high blood pressure is important to help prevent kidney failure.

The doctor explained that controlling high blood pressure is important to help prevent strokes.

The doctor stated that the patient is at high risk for complications such as kidney failure and stroke due to high blood pressure.

The doctor recommended regular treadmill exercise for about 30 minutes on most days.

The doctor stated that regular treadmill exercise can lower blood pressure by about 7 to 10 points.

The doctor emphasized the importance of being physically active.

The doctor advised the patient to lower salt intake.

The doctor advised the patient to increase dietary potassium.

The doctor advised the patient to keep salt intake under 2000 mg per day.

The doctor noted that the formal recommendation for salt intake is 1500 mg per day.

The doctor recommended the American Heart Association website for information about blood pressure, diet, and exercise.

The plan is to start spironolactone for the patient’s resistant hypertension.

The patient will have a follow-up visit in two weeks to check blood pressure and electrolytes.

The patient will have a basic metabolic panel in two weeks.

If the new medication does not control the blood pressure, the next step would be referral to a resistant hypertension clinic.

The doctor explained that the resistant hypertension clinic can evaluate secondary causes of hypertension.

The doctor explained that the resistant hypertension clinic has access to newer procedure-based technologies to lower blood pressure without medication.

The doctor described renal denervation as a procedure in which a device is placed inside the artery feeding the kidney and the artery is heated to block nerve endings and lower blood pressure.

The doctor stated that renal denervation has been shown to lower blood pressure by about 10 points.

The doctor stated that renal denervation has risks and not everyone is a candidate.

The doctor documented that the patient presents with resistant hypertension.

The doctor documented that the patient is on three blood pressure medications at maximum doses.

The doctor added spironolactone to the patient’s regimen.

The doctor plans to monitor the patient’s potassium and sodium levels.

The doctor documented that the next medication option would be carvedilol.

The doctor has tried to avoid carvedilol because of its potential to cause erectile dysfunction.

The doctor discussed with the patient the potential side effects of spironolactone, including gynecomastia and electrolyte disturbances.

If the patient’s blood pressure is not controlled on spironolactone, the doctor plans to refer him to a resistant hypertension clinic."
virtscribe_nan_VS005,"[doctor] mrn 49282721 . patient's name is jacqueline miller . use last visit exam where appropriate . hi , how are you doing jacqueline ? [patient] i'm pretty good . how are you ? [doctor] good as well . so it sounds like we are under good control right now . [patient] yes , it's doing much better . [doctor] good , good . do you have any rash left over ? [patient] yeah , i have a , a small bit left over . i started using doxycycline only once a day because i think the pharmacist said if it's getting better to just limit it to once a day . [doctor] okay , that sounds good . [patient] but i was taking it twice a day and i did notice a lot of improvement . [doctor] okay . [patient] and then when i started doing it only once a day , it seems the same and it's not continuing to get better , so it's kinda plateaued a little bit . [doctor] i see are you breast-feeding at this time ? [patient] no , not right now . [doctor] okay , good . so you , you should not be breast-feeding while you're on that medication . [patient] yeah , actually i stopped breast-feeding and then asked for the doxycycline at that time . [doctor] okay . even with the doxycycline , you can keep using the elidel . [patient] okay and i did n't take the elidel because when i read about it , i got worried , so i wanted to just try the doxycycline and see . okay , so we can talk about the elidel . a lot of the things you read about is not actually relevant to the cream or ointment form , but it's about the oral form that's used in really high doses long term after people have a heart transplant or a kidney transplant or something like that . okay , i did n't realize that . [doctor] yeah , and when you suppress the immune system that hard for that long , it can predispose you for developing cancers like hematologic type cancers . it does n't apply to as needed use of the medicine , a cream or an ointment , okay ? [patient] okay , then i can resume taking , taking the doxycycline twice a day again . [doctor] so let me clarify . what exactly are you using and then we will look at you and figure out , okay ? so you're using the sulfacetamide wash how frequently are you using that one ? [patient] twice a day . [doctor] okay , and that's not drying you out too much ? [patient] no , that's fine . [doctor] okay , and you're using the metrocream ? [patient] yes . [doctor] how often are you using that one ? [patient] after my face wash , i immediately apply the cream . [doctor] okay and then are you using any other kind of lotions or anything ? [patient] no . [doctor] so you're not using the cetaphil cleanser ? [patient] i'm not . [doctor] okay , and no neutrogena wipes ? [patient] no wipes . [doctor] okay . and then what about any lotions that you're using ? [patient] i'm not using any lotion right now , just those two . [doctor] no lotion , okay . so that may be something else we should add in a lotion to just help moisturize , but we will see . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then again when did you go down to just taking the doxycycline once a day ? [patient] that was last week , so the first 2 weeks i did twice a day . [doctor] okay . [patient] and then i started seeing improvement and then i changed to just once a day . [doctor] okay . let me take a look at your face here . i'm gon na describe for the transcriptionist what i'm seeing you're fitzpatrick skin type iv meaning you're not going to burn , you're going to suntan essentially 4-5 . [patient] and then on bilateral medial cheeks , there are a few really faint erythematous papules and just maybe a little bit of redness around and underneath your nostrils . so you're right , it's not totally gone . yeah . [doctor] i think i would go ahead and go back to twice a day everyday with the doxycycline . [patient] okay . [doctor] but i would pick up the elidel too . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] i mean i have known risks associated with medications , topicals are usually safer and preferable to oral medications . with that being said , doxycycline is low risk . [patient] it is , okay . [doctor] the doxycycline can give you bad upset stomach or heartburn it will make you sunburn even if you never sunburn , so you have to protect yourself . [patient] yeah , i mean i feel sun sensitive whenever i go out , so i am taking all the precautions with wearing a hat and all that , [doctor] great . i just wanted to make sure you knew about that . [patient] yes , i did , thank you . [doctor] alright , but i think to help get rid of it sooner rather than later , if insurance will cover the elidel , pick it up and start using it . [patient] yeah , i did check , the insurance is not covering it . [doctor] it's not , okay . [patient] well , let's look around really quick because if you use goodrx coupon , it will be around $ 30- $ 40 or something . okay . let's see , so with your coupon it was around $ 850 or something . yeah that's way too much . i agree and , and because i also looked at the urethra , that you recommended in my notes and if it is still if it's still expensive , i could try that instead . [doctor] yeah so it actually it is actually more expensive , i think the prices fluctuate . [patient] okay . [doctor] because now it's showing the cheapest of $ 70 and when i looked before , it was around $ 30- $ 40 . [patient] yeah , if it was around $ 200 , i would have picked it up , but it was coming to around $ 850 after insurance . [doctor] okay . so instead of the cream form , we could try ointment form . [patient] you mean the tacromilius ? [doctor] yeah , mm-hmm . [patient] okay . [doctor] so if we send it to pick and save the metro market , let's see where else . [patient] can you do the metro market ? [doctor] yeah , lem me put in the prescription and we'll see what we can find . [patient] sure . [doctor] pharmacy is what i'm trying to say . [patient] okay , but it's not a steroid , right ? [doctor] correct , it's not a steroid . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] it's called a calcineurin inhibitor . it's kind of like a steroid and then it calms inflammation . [patient] okay . [doctor] but it's not a steroid , so do n't use steroids on your face for sure as they'll make this kind of rash worse , but also steroids carry the risk of causing thinning of the skin . [patient] alright . [doctor] these medications do n't cause thinning in the skin and they're not going to cause some other kind of rash . the thing to know is that sometimes 5 to 10 minutes after you put it on , it can cause this weird kind of tingly or needle like sensation . or make it redder or flush but it should only last a few seconds and then go away . it's not an allergy or anything bad . [patient] okay , got it . [doctor] so it only lasts a couple of seconds . it does n't mean it's going to happen again . it's nothing bad . it will still work , so keep using it as long as you know you can stand it , okay ? [patient] okay , thank you for explaining . [doctor] so i will say apply to rash on face twice daily until resolved . [patient] okay , so only apply to the rash area ? [doctor] yes and keep using the face wash. [patient] okay . [doctor] i think you could just do it once a day . i do n't think you need to do it twice a day just because i do n't want to dry your skin out too much , okay ? [patient] i never noticed that my face is dry or got thin . i feel so good after using it . [doctor] i understand , but it could get dry and i do n't want to create other problems for you . [patient] alright . i will just wash once a day with it but it was feeling very good like there is this little bit of moisture getting back in with the other wash when i would use it twice a day , i was drying out , but not with this one . [doctor] i see . okay . well then do what feels good . if you do notice that you're starting to get dry , then reduce to once per day . [patient] that sounds good . [doctor] so to review continue using the same face wash , continue with metrocream and increase the use of doxycycline to twice a day . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then just do it until it's gone and then do it once a day for another week before stopping . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] alright and i'll rewrite your instructions here . [patient] thank you so much . [doctor] if there are any other questions or you're getting different instructions , feel free to reach out to me and we'll clarify , okay ? [patient] okay . [doctor] but in general , doxycycline is such a low risk , we're not gon na have you on this forever , and especially since we're adding the tacrolimus , i expect it will clear quickly . [patient] sounds good . [doctor] alright and i just wan na really help knock it out as fast as possible since you've been dealing with it for so long now . i would take it twice a day until it's gone and then once a day for a week before you stop . i'll write that out like that , so twice a day until rash is gone and then once a day for another week before stopping .

[doctor] i do n't expect that to happen , but you know if it does , you have the tools then you will be seeing me for a follow-up , we can figure out what to do next . i would say if it's getting worse rather than better , just give me a call or send me a mychart message , okay ?

[doctor] okay . well , it will certainly help your blood pressure if you are able to stop drinking . [patient] yeah , yeah , i , i , i agree with you . [doctor] okay . are you taking your blood pressure medications ? [patient] yeah , but i'm only taking half of the lisinopril . [doctor] okay . [patient] the well the first time i took it , i felt lethargic and tired so i only took a half dose the next time . i felt much better and i did n't have the headaches or the swishing that started in my left ear so i feel like it's definitely helping but i do n't know but i know it's not gon na be okay until i stop drinking . [doctor] and are you also taking the full dose of the hydrochlorothiazide ? do you have any chest tightness or pressure or any shortness of breath ? [patient] yeah , i'm taking the full dose of that medicine too and no , none of those symptoms . [doctor] okay . anything else i should be aware of or that we should be checking ? [patient] hmmm no .

[patient] well , in the morning i'm seeing lower numbers than in the evening where i run anywhere from like 130-145 or 150/95-100 on the bottom . [doctor] okay . [patient] but in the evenings if i sit there for a while and then take it , it goes down . kind of like when i come here , it's always high , but then it goes down . in the mornings , it's generally more normal where it's supposed to be .

[doctor] okay , so it's called naltrexone . i think the other name might be vivitrol . like i said , the research on it is pretty good . [patient] i think i may have taken the naltrexone before .

[doctor] yeah so my nurse told me you have been going out to . eat some on friday nights and saturday nights and that you have had some spicy foods or spicy shrimp . [patient] yeah , i have . [doctor] okay . well , your gut probably does not always appreciate that . [patient] no , it does n't like it at all . [doctor] yeah , so ibs is one of those things where you are very sensitive to certain things such as spicy foods or fatty foods and alcohol and this can cause lower belly stuff like cramps or you can get upper belly stuff such as nausea . [patient] i've been getting both . [doctor] okay so how frequently have you been getting or having a bowel movement on normal days ? [patient] i'm starting to notice it's between two and three times a day . [doctor] okay and are they soft stools or formed stools ? [patient] they are formed . [doctor] okay and after you have gone out , either drinking with your friends , do you tend to have more diarrhea ? [patient] yeah , i do . [doctor] okay . do you feel it's a food or the alcohol or both ? [patient] well usually we go to fridays , restaurant , i always eat pasta , the chicken alfredo . [doctor] okay , i can , i can say alfredo sauce . [patient] but it normally does n't bother me . [doctor] okay . well pasta can make you bloated but it does n't usually cause diarrhea . grilled chicken grilled chicken is usually alright . alfredo though it's higher in fat and it does contain dairy but you're saying it usually does n't bother you ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . what type of alcohol drink do you drink when you're there ? is it a sweet drink ? [patient] most of the time it's either tequila or dark liquor . i prefer petroleum , but if i get brown liquor , i only get two . every now and again , i'll drink a martini . [doctor] sometimes it's a mixture they tend to put in the drinks but it can be a variety of things so when you're not eating out or drinking what we do on a daily basis does help keep us regular so when it does flare up it it might not be as bad . have you had any luck using the fiber like citrucel regularly ? [patient] no , i guess i need to find a new drink . [doctor] okay and how is it during the week ? [patient] like what i eat . [doctor] yeah and with the diarrhea and abdominal pain , abdominal pain . [patient] right now i'm still having the cramping and sharp pains , so i've been avoiding heavy foods . i did have some fried chicken today though . [doctor] and was everything alright after that ? [patient] yeah , for the most part . [doctor] okay . remember it's also the portion sizes , so i mean if you eat a little and you feel fine , then that's okay , you have to just really watch the portions . [patient] okay , good . i ca n't go out , go without some fried chicken at least once in a while . [doctor] sounds good . alright , well , let's take a look at you today and we'll do a brief physical exam . you will hear me call out some findings . i will answer any questions and we will discuss once we have finished the exam . [patient] sounds good . [doctor] alright . so the patient is alert and cooperative , appears stated age . alright , i'm going to listen to your heart and lungs . and lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally . heart regular rate and rhythm . alright so if you could just lay back for me and i'll examine your abdomen . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , do you have any tenderness ? [patient] no , not really . [doctor] okay . so the abdomen is soft , nontender . no masses or organomegaly and let me take a listen . normal active bowel sounds . alright , you can go ahead and sit up now , thank you . so first i want you to try citrucel , it does come in a tablet you should use it twice daily for regularity then i would say if you know you're going out and possibly have diarrhea as a result , you can go ahead and use your bentyl 20 mg. you can do 1 tablet before you eat and then repeat up to four times daily . [patient] and then on days when you feel good , you do n't have to use anything , and then on friday before you leave the house , you can take a bentyl and put one in your pocket for later and then you can repeat the same thing on saturday if you want , and that will be totally fine . okay , that sounds good . [doctor] okay , and so your bentyl that's the antispasm medication and i would take the higher dose . [patient] can i get a refill of that ? [doctor] yes , absolutely . so take 1 tablet about 30 to 45 minutes before leaving the house and then the second tablet at the restaurant . then with the nausea i think we should try and see if you can recognize a pattern with what you're eating and drinking about like what makes it worse . [patient] yeah , i noticed i've been doing better with drinking water instead of sodas . [doctor] okay , good and then for your zofran , i would n't take that ahead of time , just plan on drinking plenty of water . [patient] okay . [doctor] okay and you can take it but before you do , we wan na try to reduce the triggers so watch out for greasy or fatty foods and sugary drinks . [patient] okay , i can do that . okay . and so however , if it is not just these isolated incidents and the symptoms are happening all the time , we could put you on a long-term medication that would take that you would take every night . [doctor] and so then you do n't have to use so much bentyl or the zofran . how do you feel about that ? [patient] i was actually going to ask you about something like that to help avoid flares altogether . [doctor] yeah , there is and it actually works on the chemicals in your brain that are causing your gut to be overly sensitive . one is called elavil , but the only drawback is that it can make you a little sleepy . how does that sound ? [patient] that sounds like a much better plan . [doctor] okay , great . we can definitely do that just take it every night before bedtime . [patient] okay , that sounds good . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome and so i have gone ahead and sent your prescriptions to your pharmacy . just give us a call if you have any questions or need us for anything else and then let's plan on touching base through mychart email in about a month to just check in to see how you're doing with symptoms . okay . [patient] okay , that sounds good , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome and have a good rest of your day . so review of symptoms is positive for diarrhea , nausea , and abdominal pain . assessment and plan , brittany edwards is a pleasant female with ibs and functional abdominal pain , aggravated by high stress , poor eating habits , and poor sleeping habits . i've encouraged dietary and lifestyle modifications as well as starting a neuromodulator such as elavil 25 mg at bedtime for ibs . she can use bentyl 20 mg as needed 30 to 45 minutes prior to eating out at a restaurant . she can also use zofran if needed , however , i have encouraged her to reduce greasy and fatty foods and alcohol consumption . i have asked her to follow up in 1 month by emailing over mychart regarding any side effects of issues or issues with elavil or if adjustments are needed .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS019,"[patient] next patient is emily hernandez , date of birth march 26 , 2001 . this is a 20-year-old female being seen today for her yearly follow-up for asthma , allergic rhinitis and food allergy . due to insurance changes since our last office appointment in april 2020 , she was switched from symbicort to wixela . she also uses zyrtec in the spring , summer , and fall for her seasonal allergy symptoms . which tend to work well . she also has known peanut allergy . she does tolerate almonds and cashews . please put in the asthma section at the very bottom that the act score is 21 . please put under interval history , written consent is obtained today to use dax for documentation . hi emily , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . how are you ? [patient] i'm good , thank you . so gosh , we last talked a little bit over a year ago , and it was just a telemedicine visit , but it seems like you've been doing pretty good . i know there was an insurance change . i think you had switched over to wixela , is that right ? [doctor] yep , that's right , and it's what i'm currently using . [patient] okay and that's the 250 50 dose , correct ? [doctor] yes , correct . [patient] perfect . so how does that compare ? [doctor] i mean it's working well . i really have n't had any issues with it and i take it once in the morning and once at night . [patient] and that's 1 puff twice a day . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] okay and have you been having to use your albuterol inhaler at all ? [doctor] rarely and if i do , it's really just before a workout or something like that if i know i'm really gon na be pushing it . [patient] so it sounds like it's around strenuous activity . [doctor] yes . [patient] okay . so you can do things like going to walk or going to the grocery store , no problem and just use it for more exertional stuff . [doctor] yes like if i'm gon na go for a run or something like that i'll really just take it before as a preventative . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i've been trying to use my daily if i can a little less because i'm trying to go into the military soon . [patient] no kidding , that's great . [doctor] yeah , so i have to be able to operate basically at a certain fitness level without an inhaler . [patient] really ? [doctor] yeah and if i can prove that i'm capable of these activities without an inhaler , it makes it easier . [patient] and so my inhaler , do they mean both your daily and rescue inhalers ? [doctor] mm-hmm so it's like they'll have a fitness test and basically they'll tell me not to take my inhaler that day before the test and then they'll see how the asthma affects me and they're looking to see if it's serious enough to hold me back from joining or whatever . so i have been taking it less and less and really some days i feel like i do n't need it . [patient] and that is the wixela that you're not taking . so on average per week , how many days of the week , do you use 1 puff in the morning and 1 puff at night ? [doctor] probably about three or four . [patient] okay , 3 to 4 days/week and the other days , it's once a day ? [doctor] yes , that's correct . [patient] okay . [doctor] and it's either in the morning or at night that i'm taking it . [patient] okay , do you think that's working okay ? [doctor] i do . [patient] great and any urgent care or er visits at all for breathing over the past year ? [doctor] nope . [patient] okay , so i'm going to assume no one has put you on prednisone for breathing issues then ? [doctor] nope . [patient] okay and now military wise , what's the timeframe of when you be completing some of these exertional tests , like what are your next steps ? [doctor] so hopefully i'm going to be enlisted early spring 2022 so that gives me about 6 to 7 months to get to a point where i'm able to exert my body where i do n't really need the inhaler or at least show them that i have it under control . [patient] now when you were in the other room , you completed a breathing test , correct ? correct . okay , great . so now let me ask you about the allergies , because i know typically you'll use the zyrtec in the spring , summer , and fall , correct ? [doctor] yeah , i do n't really or i'm sorry , i use it more during the spring and fall , i do n't really have to use it too much in the summer . [patient] do you use it more just as needed in the summer ? [doctor] yeah , that's right . [patient] okay , and have you been taking the zyrtec everyday recently since you're right in the mix of spring ? not every day , but i do take it on days . i know i'm going to be outside a lot . i do tend to work outside about 3 days a week , so i'll definitely take it on those days . and does it seem to work pretty well still ? are you happy with it ? [doctor] yeah , it does , it works great . [patient] wonderful , good to hear and then i'm assuming you're staying away from the peanuts , last year you had told me it worked with you worked with enterprise , renocard and one of the cars had a lot of peanuts in it that you were cleaning out and that gave you hives when you had touched it , is that correct ? [doctor] yep , that's correct . [patient] okay and has there been anything like that since that experience ? no , i do n't think so . i definitely became more cautious after that . so i usually wear , i wear long sleeves and change my gloves every time now , so i have n't had a reaction but i imagine that i probably came into contact with cars that have peanuts in them . [doctor] but they just did n't touch my skin . [patient] super and it sounds like you're really smart about it . [doctor] yeah , in the airplanes , they have peanuts , they give everyone too , so . [patient] okay and you have an epipen that you that you keep with you , correct ? [doctor] yes . [patient] okay . and i'm assuming you're going to need refills i can call you in a new set for the year . typically of course they expire within a year . [doctor] yeah , okay . [patient] and i remember sometime previously you had had some testing for tree nuts but you do have almonds and cashews correct and and you do okay with them or do you avoid all tree nuts . [doctor] i do tend to avoid all of them , but i recall eating some almonds at one point really soon after we discussed i might not be allergic to tree nuts anymore . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i remember having them and nothing happened but i usually just tend to stay away from them really if i can help it . [patient] okay . so sometimes when people have a peanut allergy , the nuts in general just are n't very important to them , [doctor] so it is very common to avoid both . so let's do this . i'll have helen come in and i would love to complete a breathing test on you . if your breathing numbers are looking great , we can work on getting you something lower than wixela , [patient] if you look at all our asthma regimens , it is a stepwise process , and wixela is a combination of two medications in one , and well maybe you do n't need both of them . maybe you just need one of them , so we can work our way backwards . [doctor] okay . [patient] and so the breathing test will help give us some more guidance , so we will look at the results in just a moment . [doctor] alright and so this past year i did get into the bad habit of vaping and smoking , [patient] but i have been trying to cut that out . so i should be good and now i only do just a little bit and i am trying to quit , so i am sure that might have an effect . it can . so what we can do today is compare your results with prior results probably before you started smoking or using the vape . [doctor] okay . [patient] yeah , and we will see where you stand at that point . [doctor] alright , that sounds good . well , lem me go ahead and listen , so hop on up here for me . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so your ears look good , a little bit of wax on both sides . can i see inside your mouth , a big ah , a ah . [patient] good . okay . let me take a peek in your nose . alright , good . you can put your mask back on . okay . and go ahead , take a big breath in and out . good . your lungs sound terrific . i'll listen to your heart . breathe quietly . okay . very good . [doctor] awesome . so your breathing test is about the same as it was a couple of years ago , it actually looks a little bit better . you may not remember , but when we last completed the test in 2019 , do you recall if you were feeling lousy at the time ? i think it was a smoke . there were so many fires at that point and i remember coming in and looking up the window and all you saw was the orange and the smoke . [patient] yes , you're absolutely right . that was a bad year . that was my first fall here and i was really alarmed . well that explains why at that time your numbers were a little bit lower and today they look better . here is what i think . so you'll have kaiser currently , correct ? [doctor] correct . [patient] okay . most insurances do limit what we can use . [doctor] yeah , i do know that . okay , so option one would be to continue using wixela like you're using it now . we would classify it as off label and you can use it once a day instead of twice a day , which is fine . some people do that because they just need it once a day . so that's an option . [patient] option two would be to actually back up to an inhaler that just has one med . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] so the one that kaiser covers is alvesco . the thing about alvesco though is that it would be 2 puffs in the morning and 2 puffs at night , so it's a bit more work . it's not breath activated , but we could step down the lowest dose to see how you do . some of the newer guidelines for asthma that we're published this year is recommending trying to treat people with inhalers like wixela or alvesco only when you're ill or say during smoke season so minimizing their use to those periods of time versus all year . unless you found out that you're getting yellow or sick , having issues every month , then that would indicate we'd pull back too much that would have too much , yeah . okay . so we could step back and possibly get you to the point where you just use those inhalers when you're ill or at smoke season , but if the first step to do any of that would be to try to drop down to just alvesco . [doctor] okay , that actually sounds really good . [patient] okay , great . so i will call that in for you . it will be the lower dose 80 mcg and you will have to do 2 puffs twice a day . [doctor] alright . [patient] okay and that will be on the box when i call it in . you can put the wixela off to the side , but do n't throw it away just in case the alvesco does n't work well for you . [doctor] okay . got it . [patient] and then ideally we would repeat your breathing test in 4 months to see how you're doing and then be able to document that you're doing well . sometimes not always , the military will require documentation on breathing tests . [doctor] okay . [patient] is your pharmacy still the same or did you update it with helen ? [doctor] yeah , i believe she updated it . it should be kaiser promonte , broadway . [patient] okay , perfect . i'll make sure it's the alvesco and then i'll renew your albuterol and epipen as well . [doctor] awesome , thank you . [patient] you're welcome . then the zyrtec , do you pick it up over the counter or you do get , do you get it as a prescription ? [doctor] i just get it over the counter . [patient] okay , got it and do you have a nebulizer that you would need refills on ? i do n't think i need any refills . i have n't used that in such a long time . i think the last time was when i had bronchitis or there was a few select times when i had to use it when i was a kid . okay , good . well , i think we have our game plan . [doctor] okay , awesome . [patient] and do the alvesco 2 puffs twice a day and your albuterol if you need it , the zyrtec 10 mg as you need it and continue to stay away from peanuts and tree nuts and i'll refill your epipen . [doctor] okay . [patient] alright , so we've got it . [doctor] great . [patient] alright , i'll have you take this to the front and i'm gon na say 4 months , recheck for asthma and we'll repeat the spirometer , spirometry at that time . [doctor] okay , sounds good . [patient] alright , well , thanks so much and you have a great day . [doctor] you too . and we will do a follow-up in 4 months with a ct and spirometry sooner if needed . follow up 25 minutes .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS025,"[doctor] okay , so our next patient is christopher watson , date of birth 4/12/1934 . mr . watson is a 86-year-old male who returns in follow-up for adult hydrocephalus . this is his first visit since undergoing shunt shunt surgery , excuse me , in august 1 , 2020 . i have followed mr . watson since may 2020 when he first presented with 8 to 10 years of progressive gait impairment , cognitive impairment , and decreased bladder control , we established a diagnosis of adult hydrocephalus with a spinal catheter protocol in june 2020 and he underwent shunt shunt surgery on august 1 , 2020 . medtronic strata programmical shunt in the ventriculoperitoneal configuration was programmed at a level of 2.0 was placed . good morning mr . watson , who is the nice lady you have with you today ? [patient] hi document this is my daughter theresa , she is the one who helps me keep things straight . [doctor] mr . watson , have you been sick or been hospitalized since your shunt shunt surgery 3 months ago ? [patient] not that i recall . no , he has n't . he has been doing much better . [doctor] good . i'm glad to hear that . before surgery , you were having some progressive problems that affected your walking , thinking , and bladder control . are these symptoms better , worse , or unchanged ? his walking has improved . he is now able to walk to the dining room just fine but he could not do that before surgery . he still has times where i have to help him . [patient] that's impressive mr . watson ? [doctor] yeah , i guess . now his bladder control did improve some after surgery but now seems to have leveled out , so he is wearing diapers . [patient] no issues with sores from wearing the diaper and any decreased or painful urination ? [doctor] no , not at all . and how about cognition ? [patient] i think i'm better . i do n't feel lost when talking to someone anymore . [doctor] dan and i both think my sister , hannah summarized it best . she said i feel like i can have a normal conversation with him again . not so wonderful . now , have you had any headaches or pain where the shunt is ? [patient] no , has n't bothered me 1 bit . [doctor] okay and any pain in your belly at all ? [patient] ca n't say that i have . [doctor] okay . sounds like you have been improving . alrighty , mr . watson , i'm gon na step out of the room while my resident comes in to do a few tests for me . is that alright ? [patient] sounds good . [doctor] okay . i'm going to go out and review the ct scan you had last month and then we will chat about it when i come in . alrighty mr . watson , so you definitely have made some improvements since the shunt surgery . now on ct scan though , i do believe i see a tiny bit of blood fluid collection in the right parietal region . [patient] now i do n't believe that that's causing any symptoms and i , it actually was n't documented by the radiologist when he read the ct scan . [doctor] what does that mean ? just that i would like to leave the shunt set for another 2 to 3 months before we go in changing it . like i said , if you're not having any headaches or pain and you have improved , so that's all good for me . so really there is , there is nothing to worry about . alright , so i'll come back in 3 months . [patient] yep , that's right . [doctor] i do have a question for you though . [patient] yeah , of course . [doctor] do you think i will be able to drive again ? man , mr . watson , i knew you were gon na ask me that one . i think at this point , it's unlikely that your movement , speed will improve to the level that would be needed for you to pass the driver's safety evaluation . now , i will say that i do occasionally have patients who surprise me . by improving over a 9 to 12-month range and that , that definitely could be you , you could definitely pass it at that point . so if you improve and we can continue to talk about that , then you know i think it could be possible , and i would be happy to recommend it . now , you could definitely also enroll in a driver's safety program without my recommendation , so you could kind of do that preemptively and then we could continue to watch for your improvement as we go . [patient] okay . i kinda figured that anyway but i just thought i'd ask i do n't like to burn anyone when i just need to run to the store , but i also know that i need to be safe . [doctor] yeah , your safety is our # 1 priority and you know i'm sure your daughters do n't mind as much , right ? they wan na keep you here and have you safe , but i overall am very pleased with how much you have improved . [patient] and so i'm sure when we talked again in 3 months , we'll continue to be on that upper trajectory of improvement . [doctor] i sure hope so don . [patient] we really appreciate all that you've done . do we make the appointment upfront ? [doctor] yeah , that would be great . the girls upfront will take care of you and get you settled for 3 months from now and you both take care , alright ? [patient] thanks .

[patient] about the same as last time . my knee is still swollen . [doctor] that was your right knee , correct ? i take it the injection , did it help ? [patient] it did maybe for a couple of weeks . [doctor] that's it and is it still painful ? [patient] yeah , it's pretty painful and now the whole leg is getting swollen . [doctor] okay . what would you say your pain level is ? [patient] i mean right now it's about a three or so but typically on the normal day , it's around six . [doctor] okay and it's been swollen like that for how long now ? [patient] since i was last here a couple of weeks after that , so about maybe 2 months now . [doctor] okay , but before it was just the knee ? [patient] yeah , the whole thing was n't swollen like this , but i tried to wear compression socks a lot of the time but it has n't been helping . [doctor] okay . okay . so that has n't been working for you . [patient] i mean it helps to some degree but it's still swollen especially around the knee . [doctor] hmmm has it been keeping you from doing things during the day ? [patient] well i slowed down a little bit and i try to do things too fast but when it really hurts is when i've been sitting for a while and then i try to get up . i'm so stiff getting up , i have to use a cane to get my bearings i mean after a little bit it loosens up but at first getting up is really difficult . [doctor] yeah , i can see , that makes sense . have you been taking your medication regularly ? you're on xeljanz , right ? [patient] yeah , the xr i think it's 11 mg a day , yeah , but i'm taking it everyday and i'm also taking celebrex , which i started maybe 2 months ago . [doctor] yeah , the 200 mix daily . how is that working for you ? [patient] pretty good up until this started swelling again . [doctor] okay well come sit over here and if you could take off your socks and shoes and we will take a look at your knee . and just to let you know , i have a service now that writes my note about the visit so you'll hear , hear me call things out and describe what i see fully . okay , gotcha . [patient] right , so let's check your leg , can you straighten it and does it hurt ? yeah , when i try to straighten it all the way , it does . [doctor] okay . range of motion slightly diminished . i'm going to press here , okay ? and how about here ? hmmm i see some pitting around the knee and ankle . normal capillary refill in the toes . does any of this area hurt ? [patient] just like an old bruise . [doctor] so i can feel that the knee is hot and that means there is something going on like some inflammation so we can give you another steroid injection for that . i also want to get an x-ray of that knee so we can see where all the swelling is coming from . yeah sounds good to me . [patient] okay and do we set up physical therapy for you last time you were here ? [doctor] no i was doing some years ago , but that was the other knee . okay so i think we will set that up for you now . we will also do an x-ray on that knee i can send you for a physical therapy and if nothing is helping then we really might need to get a surgery consult to see what we can do with that knee . [patient] okay . sounds like a plan . [doctor] alright , so for today , we'll go ahead and we'll give you the steroid shot . i'll try to see if i can get a little bit of fluid out before i do give you the injection . there might be no fluid , but i'll see if i can get anything out regardless . [patient] okay and that's the procedure you're gon na do right now ? [doctor] yep once we're done talking here and as far as the edema in your legs , we'll take an x-ray to look for the cause , but there is a lot you can . do as well . the compression socks are a good start and also do you eat a lot of salt ? [patient] i mean i , i mean i love my salty snacks . [doctor] okay . well salt does have a tendency to make your body hold on to water , reducing your salt intake could help with some of the swelling . you can also prop your feet up anytime you get a chance especially at night . [patient] and have you talked to your primary care doctor about this at all ? no , i think i would just come here first . okay . so i think try some of those things out first and if it does n't help , definitely make an appointment with them . [doctor] also as you know xeljanz is a high risk medication , so we need to check your cmp levels every couple of months so this time your levels are good but you make sure to make an appointment for the blood work for next time . [patient] alright i can do that . thank you so much doc . [doctor] yes of course well let me go ahead and get supplies and we'll get to work on your knee . fluid aspiration and steroid injection procedure . the risks , benefits , and alternatives were explained . the risks of steroid injection were explained including but not limited to hypopigmentation , soft tissue atrophy , tendon ruptures and transient hyperglycemia among others . verbal consent was obtained . the right knee was accessed through the lateral approach with 3 ml of initially clear fluid , then blood . blood tinged fluid . then the right knee was prepped in a standard fashion . the right knee was injected with 80 mg of triamcin alone . and 1 ml of lidocaine . the procedure was tolerated well with no complications . post procedure instructions were given . patient will follow up with his pcp . thank you .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS012,"[doctor] michelle king , date of birth 1/5/1986 , mrn q227631 . new patient visit for acid reflux . past medical history of anxiety and seasonal allergies . [patient] hello , are you mrs. king ? [doctor] i am . [patient] i'm dr. phillips , very nice to meet you . [doctor] you as well . [patient] how can i help you today ? [doctor] well , my primary doctor , dr. scott , he referred me here . [patient] okay . [doctor] i've just got really bad acid reflux . [patient] okay . can you tell me more about it ? [doctor] yeah . so i mean i , right now i take 40 mg of omeprazole twice a day . some days it is fine , but others are just really bad . what do you feel ? [patient] it feels like burning . [doctor] in your chest ? [patient] yes , in my chest and also in my throat . [doctor] in your throat and chest , alright . any difficulty with swallowing ? feels like food or liquids kinda get stuck ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . that's good . any abdominal pain ? [patient] no , not really . [doctor] nausea or vomiting , changes in bowel movements ? [patient] no . [doctor] constipation , diarrhea , rectal bleeding ? [patient] nope . [doctor] okay . very good . and how long have you had this problem ? [patient] i've had acid reflux since i was around 12 , but it has gotten worse over the past few years . [doctor] okay and how long have you been on the omeprazole ? [patient] on the way it is now i think about a year . [doctor] okay . do you find that it's done anything for you in the past ? i mean i can tell it's helped because some days i'll be fine and then some days i eat something and it feels terrible . are there anything that make your symptoms worse that you can pinpoint like food choices or stress ? sure , probably stress and food choices sometimes . okay . what things bother you ? [patient] spicy foods so i try not to eat them too often but sometimes even drinking a soda can cause it . we do know that caffeine and caffeinated beverages will do that even sodas even just the carbonation can cause that . how about tomato based products or citrus products ? [doctor] yeah sometimes but i still eat them . okay . it's reassuring that you are n't having any difficulty swallowing though . how has your weight been ? pretty stable ? [patient] i would say pretty stable although i have n't had much of an appetite for the past 2 months . i have been under a lot of work stress . [doctor] what do you do for work ? [patient] i'm a paralegal . [doctor] okay and any family history of gi issues ? [patient] my grandmother had esophageal cancer . [doctor] on your mom or dad's side ? [patient] mom's side and my mom had some issues like acid reflux and she was taking some medication that coats the lining of your stomach . [doctor] okay . have you ever had an upper endoscopy ? [patient] i think maybe when i was younger . [doctor] but not in the last 10 years ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you ever tried any medication other than omeprazole ? [patient] at one point i was on omeprazole and ranitidine , it did help . [doctor] but other than that , those are the only medications i have taken . [patient] okay . have a seat here and let me listen to your heart and lungs and then we can talk about a plan for you . [doctor] okay . so normal physical exam per my new patient template except for a well-healed abdominal surgical scar is noted . what's the surgical scar here on your abdomen from ? i always forget about that surgery . i had it when i was a baby . my mom said my intestines were twisted , so i had to have surgery when i was around 1 month old . gotcha , okay . so let's talk about what you have going on . from what you've told me , it sounds like you've had a several year history of gerd , which is the medical term for acid reflux . [patient] and recently your symptoms have been poorly controlled with the omeprazole 40 mg twice daily . you've been having heartburn despite taking this medication , correct ? [doctor] yes . and you've identified trigger foods like spicy foods , carbonated beverages , citrus , and tomato based foods , but you have n't cut these foods out of your diet completely yet . [patient] so the first thing i'd try is changing your diet because these foods can exacerbate your gerd even though you're taking the ppi . [doctor] okay , yeah , i could definitely do a better job of avoiding those foods . [patient] great . so stress is another trigger that we need to address . high stress can cause worsening of your symptoms . [doctor] yeah , stress and anxiety are definitely big problems for me . so working on that may help with your gerd . additionally we can consider trying a different ppi since the only one you've tried up to this point is omeprazole . if you're okay with this , we can switch your omeprazole to nexium . that's fine with me , i'm definitely open to trying whatever . perfect . i will send a prescription for nexium 40 mg twice daily to your pharmacy on file . i also recommend that you have a procedure called a egd or upper endoscopy to look for potential causes of the gerd . we sedate you and then pass a small camera through your mouth down your throat , through your stomach and end in the small intestines . [patient] we would look for any ulcers or signs of precancerous or cancerous conditions that we can take biopsies at the same time if we see anything . [doctor] okay . can i schedule that today ? yeah , you can get scheduled at checkout desk . i'll have you follow up with me in the office for the egd so we can discuss the results and talk about how you're doing with the dietary stress and medication changes . how does all of that sound ? [patient] that sounds good . [doctor] perfect . i will walk you to the check out desk . be sure to call my office and let me know if anything changes or if you have problems before your egd and follow-up appointment . please insert the procedure paragraph in the plan . i suspect that she likely has gerd with underlying functional etiology as well . reassuringly , she has no unintentional weight loss and denies any dysphagia . if her egd is normal and her symptoms persist despite a trial of nexium , we can consider a trial of protonix and obtain a ph impedance study . this will allow us to rule out abnormal acid reflux exposure and to decipher between a functional etiology and hypersensitivity .","S (Subjective):

[doctor] hi michelle , how are you doing ? [patient] not too bad and yourself ? [doctor] i'm good , thanks . so it looks like you had an infection , right ? [patient] yeah but you know i really do n't think it was a uti . [doctor] okay . [patient] i told them when i went to the er is that your phone . [doctor] it is , yeah . it listens to your knee and it does all of my documentation . it's pretty good stuff . tell me what's going on . [patient] it is in my humble opinion that i was just constipated and that was what was causing my blood pressure to be so high and i hardly pooped when i was there . then when i got home , i had a massive poop and i felt much better . i told them that when i was admitted and they did x-rays and everything , but they said no , as they did n't think that was n't , that was it . but you know i felt so much better when i got home and finally pooped . okay white cell count was the only thing that i think they were kind of concerned about because it was a little high . so i wondered if automatic dysreflexia can affect the white count . [doctor] typically it does n't . [patient] okay . [doctor] but i mean when i look at the urine cultures that they checked , the cultures are not very impressive . [patient] yeah , that's what they said . and when i go back and look , sometimes your white count is just elevated a little bit and last year it was normal so . [doctor] hmmm . but it's saying that you know inflammation can do that , so yeah , you could be backed up and inflamed . [patient] yeah . [doctor] they did n't do a cat scan , they just did an x-ray but you feel like you are back to your normal self now ? [patient] yeah . i mean i went in because i knew my blood pressure was out of control . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] it was giving me a headache and making me throw up and i know at that point i'm out of the loss of what i can do at home . yeah that you went in . so i went in and they made me feel better and then i went home as you know . [doctor] well , maybe that's all it was . [patient] yeah . [doctor] so you're doing good otherwise ? [patient] yes , i am . [doctor] good . lem me take a quick listen to you . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , go ahead and take a few deep breaths and breathe normally . [patient] now take several deep breaths . [doctor] two more . okay , good . you can relax . any pain or discomfort anywhere ? [patient] no . [doctor] great . so here are my thoughts . [patient] okay . you may recall it was extremely hot during that period of going to the hospital . i do n't know if you were inside for the most part . yeah , it was pretty hot , was n't it and i go out a bit , but i do tend to stay in more when it's hot . okay well if you do get dehydrated even just a little bit , it can lead to further or worsening constipation issues . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] i've had a lot of patients over the last couple of weeks coming in with just weird stuff and i blame it a little bit on how hot and humid it was the last 2 weeks of june so what i would do is wait a couple of weeks and then if you could come back in and we could do some complete blood work including your white blood cells and a full panel , cholesterol since it's been a while . [doctor] okay . [patient] and it should normalize , but it's too soon to do it now but maybe if i put some labs in you can come in in 2 to 3 weeks . sure , i can do that . great . so no appointment , but let's two birds with 1 stone since you're due to get blood work anyways for cholesterol . okay . and then i just wanted to make sure that the white count is okay because if it remains elevated , then that means there is something else going on with your bowels . [doctor] mm-hmm i do n't think that's what we will find , but we will see . [patient] i mean i knew going in that i had n't had a regular bowel movement in a while even though i drink the miralax everyday . [doctor] yeah . [patient] when i do n't go , i double up on that . have i ever given you laxatives would be a medicine you use in conjunction with miralax sort of a rescue type thing . is that the stuff that comes in a bottle ? yes . then yes , i have it . it takes about 2 days to work and then it's a brutal 2 days . got it , yeah , it can be a little rough but it works . [doctor] yeah . [patient] alright , so we have our plan , any questions ? yeah , well , i would like to talk to you about covid if we can . sure . so where are you at when it comes to the vaccine ? i am unvaccinated . so what are your concerns about the vaccine ? well , we do n't know the side effect . correct , we do n't . it's too soon to tell the side effects and i'm hearing more and more reports of people getting what's now termed as vaccine injury . right . right . which i had never heard of before , i do n't know if it is a new term or not , but my take on the whole thing is that i'm young and healthy enough to be even if my respiratory is limited . i also take a lot of vitamin c. okay . [doctor] alright . [patient] i also take multivitamins and i'm closely monitored so i guess i do n't feel as though i really need the vaccine . well my thoughts are that you actually should be vaccinated . i think you are high risk . if you get covid , it's not going to be good for you . [doctor] okay . [patient] and i think it's safe . i mean i understand and hear you , all of these stories out there about this and regarding the vaccine but i have seen all the bad things that could happen from covid . people have died in my practice and i do n't disagree . [doctor] that if you got covid , you'd probably be okay . [patient] yeah . [doctor] but i would consider you as someone that would make me a little bit concerned . i've had healthy people die from covid . [patient] mm-hmm . i've had some people get really , really sick from it , so personally i believe that this vaccine is completely safe , i really think that . [doctor] all of them ? [patient] yeah , i do , i do . i think there are side effects from all vaccines so you have to go back and think about it . do you get the flu shot every year ? no , i do n't . right , well , it's hard for me to convince you because you're making consistent viewpoint . well , i am open minded today . hmmm to me it's you know a lot of the stuff out there is fear and most of us health providers have gotten the vaccine . we have seen what the virus can do . i also have gotten all of my kids vaccinated . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i'm not concerned about the side effects of this . i do n't think it does anything and we have vaccinated 50 % of the country . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] the er is full of these vaccines . [doctor] i understand . [patient] so there are definitely potential side effects to the vaccine , i mean there is bar and all these things that could happen from the vaccine , but they're just very rare . i think for you is i'm not convinced that there is alternative stuff or even the treatment we have like the monoclonal antibodies that will give help but it's just my opinion . well that's what i'm here for . yeah , and right now the numbers are low even with the delta variant , when it starts mutating , it's actually good because it becomes more contagious , but less deadly . [doctor] okay . [patient] so that's what's gon na happen with covid , that's what's most , most of the science supports and this is how most pandemics end is that the virus starts losing it's potency . [doctor] sure . but think about it and if you have any more questions , you can certainly let me know , okay ? [patient] will do . [doctor] alright , anything else we can discuss today ? [patient] nope , i think i am okay , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . so we will see you in 2 to 3 weeks , have a good rest of your day . [patient] thanks , you too . headache will be acute to chronic constipation . she believes that her hospitalization was more likely due to her reflexia from her quadriplegia that typically occurs she did have a lot of vital sign changes including blood pressure fluctuations . the patient feels like she has a good bowel regimen including taking the miralax regularly as a primary treatment for constipation issues as well as lactulose for severe constipation . she feels like this was less likely a true urinary tract infection and was just related to her constipation . however , we did have a good discussion regarding her leukocytosis . i would recommend just in the next three or 4 weeks to come back in for some updated fasting labs . [doctor] and we will repeat the cbc just to make sure her white blood cells trend downward . and heading will be quadriplegia . [patient] and heading will be covid vaccine status . again , she is hesitant . we had a good discussion and i recommended that the only true preventative mechanism for covid is the vaccine . i do not believe the supplements are necessarily going to help save this off . i would be concerned if she does n't get the vaccine and i would consider her at high risk based on her quadriplegia status . she does not want to get covid , however , she needs to make these decisions . she is somewhat homeopathic .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS020,"[doctor] okay , next patient is ashley james , date of birth 12/27/2006 . ashley is a 14-year-old female who is previously healthy , now here for evaluation of abnormal renal ultrasound with an atrophic right kidney . [patient] hi , good afternoon ashley , how are you doing ? [doctor] i'm doing okay . how are you ? [patient] i'm doing well , thanks so much for asking . i'm dr. rogers , i'm one of your kidney doctors and you guys must be mom and dad . [doctor] yes , that's correct . great . well , alright , it's so nice to meet all of you . i wish it was under better circumstances , but we are gon na figure it all out here today . speaking of that , let's go ahead and review some of your past medical history , [patient] and then i'll complete an exam of her heart and lungs and kinda move from there . would that be alright with you , ashley ? [doctor] yeah , that sounds good . [patient] okay . so as i understand it , ashley was found to have a small , a kind of a small kidney on one side . [doctor] tell me about when that was . i do also have records of everything , but i just like to hear the story of how it was found out and what you're doing that got us here today . [patient] sure so ashley came home 1 day sick out of nowhere , rubbing her stomach and she said it was hurting her on her right side and it was so bad that she was bent over in pain . [doctor] okay . [patient] they automatically thought appendix . [doctor] sure that makes a lot of sense . we took her to her doctor , they treated her for a stomach virus , they gave her fluids and sent her back home and the next day she was twice as bad as the first day . [patient] goodness , okay . than what happened . [doctor] yeah , so i took her back again and they did more testing . i think they did an ultrasound or something and that's where they found that one kidney was bigger . [patient] okay . [doctor] then at that time , they told us to follow up with our primary the next day , which we did but he was heading out on vacation so he only saw her for a brief 10 minutes and then we were out the door . so she was still throwing up in a lot of pain so i took work off to help her . [patient] wow okay . [doctor] we took her down to jacksonville where they did see her and basically told us the same thing that they did n't think one of her kidneys was working at all . they called it atrophic and that it was a lot smaller than the other one . [patient] already then , then what happened . [doctor] yeah , then they found cysts or something on her kidney and ovaries and maybe some other places . her lymph nodes were swollen and they found some infection . they told us to follow up with her doctor , which we figured since she was still sick . [patient] okay . and then when you followed up with your doctor , what happened then ? [doctor] yeah , it did n't seem to be getting any better within a day or two , so we followed back up with her doctor , who was course still out of town with no one to see her in his place , so we ended up coming to atlanta . we stayed here for about 4 days . they did see her and treated her . [patient] okay . i am so sorry for all of that back and forth , but glad to know that there was some late at the end of that tunnel . [doctor] thank you . and then after they saw her , she did seem to get a little better . she has n't had any more throwing up or anything since . but she still complains about a lot of pain in her stomach . [patient] hmmm . okay . [doctor] yeah and she mentions burning too , especially when she eats and stuff like that . alrighty , okay , well that was a really good review . so ashley before all of this , would you say that all in all you were a pretty healthy child ? she is , yeah , before that , she was completely fine . they said they think at some point she had a severe infection that might have affected her kidney . [patient] gotcha . okay . so one other thing too when she was 4 years old , she was in the hospital three or four times sometimes for 3 days at a time . i do n't think they did any test to see what the infection was or even where it was coming from . they just gave her fluids , an antibiotic and they would send us home . [doctor] hmmm . [patient] okay . [doctor] yeah and so a week or two later she would have a fever and symptoms and basically the same thing . we went through that for a couple of months and then it just stopped , so she had no problems since , but the doctor suspects that she's had kidney problems since then . so we just wan na see if she's alright or if , if it needs to be taken out , maybe , we wan na do whatever needs to be done . [patient] yes , absolutely . it sounds like this road has been very much so rough to navigate too , so we'll , we'll get you through for that . is it ashley taking any medications daily right now ? [doctor] only pepcid . [patient] okay . [doctor] yeah , so she takes 40 mg of pepcid a day and then also takes claritin for allergies . [patient] alrighty and any difficulties with your pregnancy with her or during delivery ? [doctor] no . renal disease does run in my family though . my dad , aunt and my cousins all have issues with their kidneys . i have their paperwork right here for you with their diagnosis . [patient] great . i will definitely review that over . any other family history to be aware of ? [doctor] yes , my mom had breast cancer too . [patient] okay . great . alrighty . so just over a quick review , it does look like your your father had a kidney transplant , is that correct ? [doctor] yes , that is correct , he did . [patient] okay , so obstructive neuropathy . sounds like he was born with it and something something made it , so he could n't urinate correctly , does that sound right ? [doctor] yes , and they did n't catch it in time . [patient] i'm so sorry to hear that . [doctor] yeah , he actually died at 47 of a massive heart attack . [patient] my goodness . wow , i am so sorry to hear that . but thank you so much for you know all of these pieces really help knit the story together for ashley so we can get her the best care . [doctor] you're welcome . okay . so you said her aunt also has had kidney disease . [patient] yes , well it was my dad's sister , so her great aunt . [doctor] okay and okay i'm looking here . [patient] it looks like , do you know what the name of diagnosis , it does n't seem to be mentioned . [doctor] this is what she sent me . endstage renal disease , chronic kidney disease , stage v , diabetes , hypertension , that's all i have to work on for her . [patient] okay and that's okay , let me see if that is all when she was an adult when all of that happened ? [doctor] correct , yeah . [patient] already . okay . [doctor] and it also looks like ashley has seen a gi and a geneticist where they did n't find anything clinically significant mutations on the panel that they did . [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . so that's all good . so ashley a few questions for you if that's alright . how are you feeling right now ? not feeling too bad , my stomach just hurts just a little bit , it's burning a little bit . [patient] okay and any pain when you go pee ? [doctor] sometimes it's just hard to start sometimes . [patient] okay and any blood in your pee ? no , not that i've noticed . [doctor] okay . [patient] she does complain that it burns when she pees when she drinks certain drinks like soda so she will only drink gatorade or water . [doctor] okay , yeah , so we do see that some people are very sensitive when they drink certain items , especially the carbonation it can make it burn a little bit when they urinate okay so lot of different pictures of her kidneys here and we'll review all of that here in a moment . [patient] okay . [doctor] alrighty , but before i review that , i wan na look through a quick exam and just see how things are doing . you will hear me speak a loud the exam just to make sure i'm getting everything documented . [patient] okay . [doctor] alrighty , please use my physical exam template . so , ashley , i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart if you will just breathe normally for me , okay ? [patient] okay . [doctor] good . lungs and heart sound great . alrighty . so your physical exam you know everything seem appears you know you are well-appearing female , alert and oriented , sitting comfortably on my chair today i hope with no acute distress . exam otherwise within , within normal limits . okay . so where does that all leave us . the good news is that her kidney functions do look good as , as does her blood pressure . we want to keep an eye on both of those things as she is at a higher risk for developing high blood pressure and something that we call proteinuria . [patient] which is where your kidneys do n't work as well as they should and we end up seeing protein in your pee . [doctor] okay . [patient] or excuse me herpes . her right kidney is a little bit smaller , which is making her left kidney work harder , possibly causing the left to appear bigger , and it's something that we wan na keep an eye on , but nothing for us to do with anything today . [doctor] okay . thank you . [patient] i also recommend that on an annual basis , we do kind of the following things . so i wan na have an ultrasound to monitor the size of her kidneys and their overall function . [doctor] complete a urinalysis to continue to make sure that protein and blood are not in her in her pee and do a blood pressure check . additionally , let's avoid nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines like ibuprofen and opt to use tylenol instead . okay , that sounds good . [patient] okay and does ashley play any sports ? [doctor] yes , she is active in softball and she wants to join the drill team over the summer . [patient] how fun , i used to play soft ball back in the day . so it'll be very important that during those activity she stays well hydrated . i really wan na avoid dehydration as it puts tremendous strain on her kidneys . so i'm gon na recommend at least 2 l/day of water . [doctor] okay , great . we will work on that . okay . i also recommend a healthy diet and continue her active lifestyle . this will help keep her and her kidneys healthier as an adult , so if we can start those behaviors early , we'll be in a good space as she progresses . we can do that . we already do try to eat very well . [patient] good . good . so for her next appointment , she can either meet with her primary care physician or an adult nephrologist closer to you guys at home . you do n't have to come all the way out here . [doctor] okay , that sounds great . [patient] okay . that was a lot . do we need any additional questions clarified or anything you can always give us or your primary a call if you think of anything or if certainly if symptoms worse . [doctor] no , i do n't have any additional questions and i'll , i'll definitely give you a , a phone call if we do and thank you so much . this was so helpful . [patient] awesome . well , thank you guys for making the trip and ashley it was really nice to meet you . mom and dad , he was well and i hope you guys take care . [doctor] you too . alrighty , past medical history , review of patient's grandfather's record , we see he had posterior urethral valves and obstructive neuropathy . he developed chronic kidney disease and was on was dialysis dependent . he had a renal transplant which subsequently failed , died of dialysis in his 40s . is that right ? now that you've started it does , i do n't understand that he unless they were giving the grandfather's record , but did you wan na do this on your own , this recording ? [patient] yeah , that's yeah , that will work because i'm gon na have to drop for this , but i think we're good for everything else . [doctor] and he did die in his 40s , that's what it said in the note earlier . [patient] okay . yeah , he died in his 40s , but i thought it was from a massive heart attack , died at 47 , of a mess . [doctor] he died , it , it's saying that meant means that he died on like he was , he was utilizing dialysis . [patient] not because of it , okay . [doctor] yeah . [patient] cool , i'm gon na stop that .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS022,"[doctor] patient mrn abc 123 . date of birth january 1 , 1960 . patient is a 60-year-old right handed male referred today for evaluation of numbness and tingling . hello mr. cook , how are you doing this morning ? [patient] hi dr. martinez , this weekend was a bit rough . i've had this numbness and tingling for a few weeks now . [doctor] so it's in both of your hands ? [patient] yes , ever since my car wreck last december when i broke them , well once they healed i mean i noticed it more , the tingling and the numbness , [doctor] and you still wear the splint only on the right wrist ? [patient] no , i also wear the left sometimes , the right is just worse but the splint helps . both have really gotten worse over the last month and i broke them my right wrist was definitely in worse shape . i've also been having some mild stiffness in my neck too . i hit my head during the accident and they told me it was a contusion . [doctor] and where would you say the tingling and numbness is ? [patient] on this side , it goes from here and here up to about here on the other side , it's from here to here . [doctor] i see . so on the right side you're pointing from the middle and ring finger all the way up the forearm and on the left the symptoms extend from the pinky and ring finger and is there any pain or just tingling and numbness ? it's mainly just sore , sometimes they throb but overall they feel weaker too especially when i'm using them . the tingling happens more when they hurt , but when it goes away , the tingling is dull . [patient] and when do you feel these symptoms ? well , really i guess just more so at night and they come and go throughout the day . [doctor] okay and do you experience any loss of sensation in your hands or fingers ? [patient] like feeling something , no , not that i can really think of though in general they maybe less sensitive than they should be but i can still feel they also gave me some nerve pain medicine , but i have n't been taking it like i should . [doctor] and are you still on the coreg for hypertension and the lexapro for anxiety ? [patient] yes , i'm still taking those . i had prediabetes too , but i got it under control by changing my diet . [doctor] and no history of thyroid issues , correct ? [patient] no . [doctor] ri thank you mr. cook okay first we'll go over your review of systems correct me if i'm wrong in any of this constitutional you have fatigue and weight gain gi you have excessive appetite and bloating eyes have floaters , cardiovascular shows shortness of breath and leg swelling , endocrine , you're always hungry , skin , you have some nailbed changes , dryness , and itching , musculoskeletal , you have gout and muscle pain , and the remainder of the review of systems is negative . [patient] yeah , that's all correct . [doctor] alright we are going to go ahead and do the neurologic examination . let's look at the right hand first . can you feel this ? [patient] yeah , but a little less on these two fingers . [doctor] sensation is normal except pinprick sensation diminished in the third and fourth fingers on the right and how about on the left ? [patient] yeah but these two are little less . [doctor] sensation is decreased in the fourth and fifth fingers on the left . okay , let's test your reflexes now . reflexes are 1+ and symmetric . 2+ knees , toes are downgoing bilaterally . alright , i'm going to tap on your right wrist . do you feel anything ? [patient] yeah , it feels like a zing of my wrist and something into my elbow too . [doctor] and how about the left side ? [patient] yeah , same on that side too . [doctor] tinel's sign positive at both wrists and both elbows . rest of exam is normal . alright so what i am seeing today is bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome or potentially this could also be bilateral cubital tunnel syndrome . however , your symptom presentation suggests bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome as the nerves in your wrist are aggravated by your past trauma . this is causing the pain and tingling you were describing to me . okay . so how we make it better ? first , i want to determine exactly where the nerve irritation is coming from . we will need to schedule you for a nerve test , which is called an emg test . they will measure the responsiveness of your nerves to truly pinpoint where you're having your issues .

[doctor] so let's talk about your symptoms real quick . obviously with the chest discomfort , we worry about heart issues but i'm reassured that those were ruled out with all the testing they did in the er , [patient] other potential causes could be anxiety , esophagitis , which is irritation of the esophagus , but typically with these but typically these cause the pain that would last for a long time rather than that isolated incident like you had , [doctor] it's also possible that you had intense heartburn for a few days . [patient] well since you mentioned anxiety i was going through a really stressful job transition right around the time that happened . [doctor] okay that's good to know . the stress from this could , could be very well have contributed to your condition . [patient] okay . [doctor] so we could do an egd or an upper endoscopy to take a look at your esophagus and stomach . this would allow us to look for esophagitis , but since your symptoms occur , 3 months ago and you have n't had any additional episodes . it's likely that if it were esophagitis , it's already healed by the point , by this point and we would n't be able to see anything . the other option is just to continue to monitor . [patient] for any additional symptoms at which point we could do the egd with you being asymptomatic for so long right now , i'm comfortable with that option , but what do you think ? i would like to hold off on the egd and wait to see if i have more symptoms . [doctor] that sounds good . so you can call my office if you have any additional episodes of pain or any other symptoms you're concerned about . if that happens , we will get you scheduled for an egd to take a look . if not , you can follow with me as follow up with me as needed for any other gi complaints . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . you do n't have any questions for me . i'll walk you out to the checkout desk . [patient] no , that's it . thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . right this way . [patient] alright in assessment , please summarize the patient's history briefly and let's list for possible etiologies such as gerd , dyspepsia , esophagitis , musculoskeletal etiologies , and anxiety , [doctor] suspect she had an anxiety attack related to her job transition plus or minus a contribution from her musculoskeletal etiologies in the plan include our discussion of the egd versus monitoring monitoring for symptoms patient elected to self monitor for symptoms and will call with any recurrence or change thanks .","S (Subjective):

[patient] hi doc , nice to meet you . [doctor] i was just reviewing your records from doctor howard and he has referred you because the work-up for headaches revealed a mass in your pituitary gland .

[patient] located behind my eyes , it's like a dull nagging ache . [doctor] okay . was the onset gradual or sudden ? [patient] well this started about 3 months ago and they've been getting worse over time , at first it was like 3 out of 10 in severity and it just gradually worsened , now it's about 6 out of 10 in severity . the headaches do tend to be worse in the morning and feels like a dull ache behind the eyes .

[doctor] okay so there is a smoker at home you know that does that does affect you so we might have to have a conversation with your brother and anybody else but it's good to know that people are n't sick i do see here though that you have kind of a a history of recurrent strep like you you seem to be having these sore throats a lot i think it says that you've had four in the last five months is that correct
[patient] yeah strep and bfs i'm not quite sure what it is just seems to come on you know i get this sore throat and fibroid i'm told i have strep
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes you know my doctor knows what he is doing strep everyday strep everyday but anyway if he says i have strep then i have strep
[doctor] i okay i respect that and i'm glad that you you listen to him at the end of the day that's always a good thing alright so now that we've gotten like kind of a lot of the history out of the way i do want to do my physical exam is that okay
[patient] sure
[doctor] alright so when i look in your throat like i'm not noticing any erythema no swelling your tonsils are midline so those look good when i'm feeling here on your neck i'm not appreciating any like lymphadenopathy no cervical adenopathy and like i wan na check those things because i just wan na make sure i'm not seeing any physical signs of like any kind of strep right now right i do n't want i wan na make sure you're not having an infection when i listen to your lungs i do n't appreciate any wheezes rales rhonchi that means i'm not hearing funky sounds your heart sounds great no murmur no rub no gallop when i press on your back remember you told me you had that left back pain when i press on it does it hurt
[patient] no
[doctor] okay alright great no tenderness on palpation when i press on your abdomen are you feeling any pain
[patient] no
[doctor] alright no rebound no guarding that's great okay so based on my physical exam we are gon na have a couple conversations one that ct that your your primary care doctor the the one that you you question his judgment it is showing a couple things that we are a little concerned about it could be that these recurrent strep episodes that you've been having it looks like they are like potentially that they are caused something called glomerulonephritis right there's just some some swelling here and we have to be careful of something like that because it could lead to like kidney disease chronic kidney disease and we wan na make sure that we cut that off right so the first thing is i'm gon na refer you for your problem of glomerulonephritis i'm gon na refer you to an ent i want them to look at you and maybe consider taking out your tonsils to see if that could help with some of the recurrent strep though that you're feeling but i would like to leave that to them to make that decision for you and me we're gon na do some more like confirmations right i'm gon na order some labs i want several a lipid panel a ua a cmp a cbc a vitamin d and a tsh all of these things will give me more information about kind of like what's happening in your body right now in terms of like your hormones and you know your iron levels and to make sure that you are like getting all the nutrition that you need and that your body is operating appropriately i know that that was a lot of words but let me know what questions do you have about your care and your treatment
[patient] how much are all these tests going to cost
[doctor] they are going to be free ninety nine because your mom is paying for them
[patient] okay that's that's good to know
[doctor] yes
[patient] and when do i when do i have to do those tests
[doctor] i would prefer you to get them done as soon as possible so when you walk out of this room there is a a blood lab right next door i need you to go ahead and do some of those draws some of them i will need you to not have eaten we are gon na do them it's called fasting and you can make sure that you have n't eaten when you do but they will the lab techs will know so you will be able to knock out most of those today
[patient] okay and i'm not sure i will be able to do that today because i have a class right after this
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and right after that i have to go to work
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] you know if i told you i'm about changing jobs did i
[doctor] no you did n't mention that but one of the cool things about being a doctor is i can write you a note so you're gon na do it and then you can go to the class and we could figure it but like it's really cool that you're changing jobs i'm happy for you i hope you know that like it's always great to be able to make some income and make some decisions that means that you'll be able to start paying for your test soon uh
[patient] well yeah this new job there is no insurance and my old boss sucks so i'm hoping i'll get a new boss and you know hopefully some free food with with this ut because it's had a restaurant so we'll we'll see how that goes
[doctor] we might have to have a conversation about the free food at the restaurant if we do n't get some of these infections under control because your salt intake is about to be very important okay
[patient] got it
[doctor] alright okay so do you have any more questions before i send my nurse in

aci_nan_ACI019,"[doctor] hey angela how are you
[patient] i'm good how are you
[doctor] i'm good so i see we are here you had a recent diagnosis of stage three non-small cell lung cancer and so we are following up on your neo adevant chemotherapy so you can you tell me how you're doing today
[patient] yeah you know i'm i'm doing okay i have a little bit of some shortness of breath that i noticed over the weekend and you know i i'm i considered myself pretty active before this i would walk my dog around the block and now i i ca n't even walk you know down the street without being short of breath
[doctor] okay yeah yeah i mean that's that's definitely understandable it says you had a four point four centimeter left upper lobe nodule in there so it's kinda big but that's understandable and we're doing the chemo to try to reduce that that that tumor that you do have so how often do you normally run with your dogs
[patient] i mean i would i would take them for i would normally take them for like mile long walks everyday and just this weekend i could only walk down to the end of the street i had to have my husband take the dog fit walk
[doctor] man okay what kind of dog do you have
[patient] i have a dobrman
[doctor] yeah they are pretty active that makes sense alright so have you been coughing have you had any phlegm
[patient] i've been having a dry cough no phlegm
[doctor] okay have you noticed any fever
[patient] no fever
[doctor] no fever alright what about any other symptoms like any body aches any sore throat sinus pain
[patient] well i mean now that you mentioned it like every time i swallow it hurts it does n't feel like i have a cold because it hurts down here more in my chest but every time i swallow it it's really painful
[doctor] okay so when you are swallowing i know some of my patients feel this do you feel like the food is getting stuck
[patient] no the food is not getting stuck it just hurts
[doctor] okay what about when you're you're taking liquids are you able to take in both hydrocort liquids
[patient] i mean i definitely feel like over the weekend i have n't been taking it as much because it hurt so much but i i am able to i am able to drink and i've been taking ensure and things like that i had a milk shake
[doctor] okay that's that's that's that's good yeah we we definitely want you to to take in as much liquid as possible best especially since you're on the chemotherapy and the radiation just so you wo n't get dehydrated because that will make you feel a lot worse if you are dehydrated okay so on a on a mental emotional standpoint i know you said you have your husband with you how you doing with that you have the support that you need you need to speak to me though
[patient] it's very helpful you know as you can understand i'm just like devastated when i got this diagnosis and i'm just i'm just trying to figure everything out and but he is very good and my daughter is is very helpful too and i you know i think for the most part i'm very fortunate to have them
[doctor] okay so how how are you feeling on your chemo see you're on a combination of cisplatin and etoposide you had your last dose a few days ago any nausea any fatigue from that
[patient] i was a little nauseated and tired but i took the zofran that you prescribed and that seemed to help and you know i i got some rest it's it's it's been okay
[doctor] okay that's good so let me do a quick physical exam on you just gon na check your vitals here so your vitals are normal your pulse ox is okay so everything's good with that so i'm gon na feel your neck on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any cervical lymphadenopathy no subclavicular adenopathy your heart exam regular rate and rhythm no murmur your lung exam so i do notice some crackles in your lungs bilaterally that's just a faint sound we hear when you take a deep breath so that could mean you have some fluid in there and that is to be expected due to your lung cancer diagnosis so i'm gon na look at your skin exam so on your skin exam on your chest i do see some erythema on the anterior aspect of your chest on the left side and that could be due to that radiation sometimes patients do get a radiation burn and it's it'll get better with time especially once you're done with the the radiation treatment and on your extremity it there is no lower extremity edema in your legs so prior to coming to see me you did get a chest x-ray it looks like you do have mild radiation pneumonitis that means you have inflammation of your lungs due to the radiation so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so your first diagnosis you know is is the lung cancer so we are gon na continue you on that chemo regimen on that you do have continue on that that current radiation doses i think you're on forty five gray yep you're on that and then when the when the regimen's complete we'll do some more testing and hopefully we can see a resection of that tumor so that has just gotten little smaller and we can go inside and and take it out so for your second diagnosis the radiation pneumonitis i'm gon na prescribe you a low dose steroid prednisone forty milligrams one tablet a day for five days have you been on on a steroids before
[patient] no i've only ever heard bad things about them they make people jittery and gain weight
[doctor] i mean and and i for you that's that that's for patients that you know who are on them for a a long period of time right you're only gon na be on it for five days that should n't affect you too bad you might feel when you coming off of it after the five days a few muscle aches other than that you should be fine you should n't really experience much weight gain other other than not not much at all since you're only on on it for five days so but that's gon na help you reduce some of the inflammation in your lungs help you breathe better so we can continue the radiation treatment because we definitely need to do that because our most important thing right now is to try to decrease the size of that tumor okay and then for your third issue the oddy ophagia or it come terms the painful swallowing right you said you had that from the from the radiation so that's from the inflammation of your lungs that's kinda creeping up to your esophagus that's why you're you're feeling that pain so i'm gon na prescribe you a lidocaine squishy and swallow you can do that four times a day and so you'll do it and you'll be able to eat immediately afterwards because it would do some of that pain free from swallowing and that will help you taking liquids and food because we definitely need you well off it and and and hydrated while you're going through this cancer therapy okay

[patient] it is yes
[doctor] okay what kind of venture are we gon na go into do you do you have the the script or no it it just talks
[patient] but it's it's not presenting like like how you're reading it like how you're talking about it is it kinda what i'm saying because like after that i'm supposed to say yeah whenever i take my husband out to like a nice restaurant i have trouble adjusting to those dim lights but i'm not really getting the question of like so what's causing it or where do you have this happening stuff like that so i'm a little confused
[doctor] okay i mean i can just straight out follow the script just so we can kinda get it rolling so so i said so hi so it looks like the technician noticed that you've been having a decrease in vision when reading and straight lines in your door frames have been looking crooked to you

[doctor] okay so on your physical exam there seems to be no tenderness to palpation of your abdomen there is cva tenderness on your your right side here and that's due to that kidney stone so we did get a a ct scan before you came in so it does show that you have a stone measuring point five centimeters in size located on the proximal right ureter so that's that duct that passes from your kidney to your bladder i do n't see any evidence of hydronephrosis so there is nothing obstructing causing swelling in your your kidney so that's good to hear so i do n't think you hopefully wo n't need any surgery for this one so let's talk a bit little bit about on my assessment and plan so you know you've done this a couple of times you have that kidney stone so what i want you to do is just have you continue to push fluids and hopefully we can pass the stone your pain your pain you're doing okay right now so i'm just gon na continue you on that ibuprofen do you think that's that's working you said for you
[patient] so far so good but since the weekend is coming around i i i rather have something stronger if it's possible
[doctor] okay so i can prescribe you some tramadol you know that should help fifty milligrams that should help you out if you do have any of that pain if you get any breakthrough pain from that you can take that ibuprofen it should help you you know with everything and hopefully you can get through that weekend i know you went to the your pcp prior to coming to see me did they give you a strainer
[patient] they did they did yeah and i've been i've been using that but so far nothing
[doctor] okay so continue to use the strainer whenever you urinate so hopefully we can catch the stone i'm also gon na order a bmp a urinalysis and urine culture and based on what that shows we can see if we need to put you on any antibiotics i do n't think you have an infection but you know there is that possibility and then i want to see you again in one to two weeks if you are still having symptoms and if you know you still have the stone with you we can talk about further treatment possible lithotripsy you know that's the shockwave treatment i'm pretty sure you've had that prior to

virtscribe_nan_VS006,"[doctor] next patient is christine hernandez . date of birth is january 13 , 1982 . hey miss christine , how are you doing today ? [patient] i'm good , thanks , how are you ? [doctor] i'm pretty good . so it looks like you've completed the covid vaccine , that's great . [patient] yes , i did . [doctor] anything new since your last visit ? [patient] no , i did all the tests that you had recommended me to take . i have n't been able to take the thyroid medicine . the one that you prescribed as i'm still taking my old one , the price is a little high on the new one . [doctor] okay , so did , did you try the coupon that i gave you ? [patient] i did not try the coupon . there was a charge of $ 75 . [doctor] okay , well , next time that , that coupon should help , but it should only be about three dollars . [patient] okay . i do n't have it . do you happen to have another one you can give me ? [doctor] yep , right here . [patient] wonderful . thank you so much and and then the gel they are charging me $ 100 for it , so i do n't know if this is because it's a , it's walmart or if i should try somewhere else or maybe you know how or where i could get it cheaper . [doctor] yeah , let's try something else . sometimes it can be cheaper if we just prescribe you the individual ingredients of a medication rather than the , the combined medication itself . [patient] that would be great . [doctor] so that's clindamycin gel and benzoyl peroxide maybe by doing them separately , they could be a lot cheaper so that we can do , the unithroid with the discount code should only be about nine dollars for 90 days . [patient] okay , that would be great , yeah , they were charging me $ 75 and i just could n't pay that . [doctor] maybe we try a different pharmacy as well . [patient] okay . so do you think that my weight gain could have been the birth control that i was taking before that caused it ? [doctor] maybe . i do n't really see an endocrine cause for it at least , so i would need to see the , the hyper and dragonism or high testosterone or a high dhea to cause acne or hair growth or any of that stuff , but the numbers are n't showing up out of range . [patient] okay . [doctor] i really do n't see any endocrine cause for it , like i said , your growth hormone was fine , but we definitely want to and need to treat it i do n't know if we talked about maybe a little weight loss study . [patient] you mentioned the weight loss study and you mentioned that i have some meal plans that you had given me , i still have those two . [doctor] have you tried to make any changes in the diet since the last time we spoke ? [patient] i've been trying to get better . i will start back at the gym in july because of my contract , i had to put a hold on it until then . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i do want to start doing that . i will be a little freeer since i'll be on vacation after july 8 . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] and then my cousin was telling me to ask you about cla because it's supposed to help your metabolism , is that okay to take ? [doctor] i'm not sure , what is the cla ? [patient] i'm not sure what it is either . [doctor] okay , well , i'm unfamiliar with it , so . [patient] okay . i also have a coworker who has a thyroid issue too and she suggested to try chromium for weight loss . [doctor] so that likely will not help too much . you could try it either if you really want to but then they will not accept you into the weight loss study if you try those two . [patient] okay . [doctor] chromium is just a supplement and it wo n't help that much . [patient] it wo n't , okay , thank you . [doctor] it wo n't hurt like i should n't say that it wo n't hurt , but it also wo n't help that much , so it's up to you . [patient] okay and so my cousin also suggested amino acids and that i might find them in certain foods i guess for my workout . [doctor] yeah , amino acids are fine , they wo n't , wo n't really help with weight loss either , but it might help you replenish and just kind of feel hydrated . [patient] okay , are they proteins , my cousin said she had lost some weight and has been working out every day but she does n't work , so i do n't know . [doctor] yes , i mean acids are what make up the protein , which is in any food you eat with any protein , so meat , dairy , nuts , any of that sort of thing . [patient] okay , thank you , got it . [doctor] alright are you allergic to any medications ? [patient] no , not that i know of . [doctor] okay . is your skin pretty sensitive ? [patient] yes . [doctor] alright . [patient] yeah , on my sides , i will start getting rashes with different products . [doctor] and have you ever tried clindamycin topical as an antibiotic for your acne ? [patient] no , i've never tried anything for it . [doctor] okay . we may give you some of that . [patient] okay and i also want to mention that my feet do swell up a lot . [doctor] okay . i'm , i'm gon na take a look at that for just a moment . any constipation ? [patient] yes , i also do have that problem . [doctor] alright . miralax will definitely help with that . [patient] okay , yes , my doctor did also recommend that . [doctor] great . alright , let's do an exam real quick . please have a seat on this table and i'm gon na listen to your lungs and heart . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright . deep breath , alright again . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright sounds good . [patient] great . [doctor] let me take a look at your feet and ankles . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , they look okay right now . certainly let your doctor know about this if it gets any worse or reoccurs . [patient] okay , i'll do that . [doctor] now let's go over your lab work . so when you took that pill , the dexamethasone test , you passed , which means you do n't have cushing syndrome on that test at least . the salivary cortisol though unless you did one wrong , two of them were completely normal , one was abnormal , so we might need to repeat that in the future . [patient] okay , that's okay . [doctor] alright , so your cholesterol was quite high , the total cholesterol was 222 , good cholesterol was about 44 , the bad was 153 and it should be less than 100 . the non-hdl was about 178 and it should be less than 130 . the good cholesterol should be over 50 and it was 44 . so your screening for diabetes is was fine . you do have a vitamin d deficiency and i do n't know if we started the vitamin d yet or not . [patient] yes , we did . i , i do need to take one today though . [doctor] okay . so i also checked a lot of other pituitary hormones , iron levels , everything else seemed to be pretty good and in decent range . [patient] okay , that sounds great . so i wanted to also show you my liver enzymes because i have n't come back since then , but i was also happy because one of them was back to normal . [doctor] okay , great . let's see them . [patient] okay , so the one that's 30 that was almost 200 , not so long ago . [doctor] yeah , your alt was about 128 . [patient] okay and , and back in october it was 254 . [doctor] yeah , this is much better . [patient] okay , great , and then it dropped in january and then it dropped a little more in march since i stopped taking the medicine in december . [doctor] okay , that's good . so i'm proud of you with the course of your labs so before i forget , i'm gon na just put your labs into the computer today and i wo n't be checking your vitamin d level for some time . [patient] okay . so with the thyroid and the low vitamin d , does that always happen together ? [doctor] i do have a lot of people that have thyroid thyroid issues and they have vitamin d deficiency . [patient] okay . [doctor] this is what i'm , i'm going to do , i'm going to put , print out your prescriptions so you can shop around at the pharmacies and see if you can find better prices . [patient] okay , that way i can go ask them and try cvs . [doctor] yeah , that sounds like a plan . [patient] okay , good . so the weight loss study that you mentioned , when does that start or how does that work ? [doctor] so we are about to start as we just got approval last week and we are just waiting on our paperwork , so we can get started . [patient] okay and what's involved with that ? [doctor] so it'll involve you receiving a medication , which has been used for diabetes treatment , and it works mostly in the gut on satiety or satiety hormones . the most common side effects are gon na be nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation , there are six arms to the study , one is the placebo , the other ones are various , various dosages of the medication , excuse me , you would receive an injection once a week also keep in mind that most of the weight loss medications are not covered by insurance . [patient] okay . [doctor] so it's a way of getting them but the odds of getting one of the arms with the medication that are in your favor right might be only 1 out of 5 of our 100 patients that we have on the list for the study that will receive the placebo . [patient] okay . [doctor] does that make sense ? [patient] yes , it does . [doctor] so we do expect pretty big weight loss because of what we learn in the diabetes study , so it's a year long process and it's an injection once a week . you come in weekly for the first four or 5 weeks , i believe and then after that it's once a month . you do get a stype in for participating in the study and parking is validated and whatever else that you need for the study . [patient] okay , do you know how much the skypond is ? [doctor] i will have to double check for you and you do n't have to be my patient , you just have to meet the criteria so the criteria is a bmi greater than 30 if you do n't have any other medical condition or a bmi greater than 27 if you do have other medical condition like your cholesterol bmi greater than 27 would qualify you . [patient] i have a friend who might be interested and she does have diabetes . [doctor] if she has the diabetes , then she wo n't qualify . [patient] okay . you ca n't if you , if you have diabetes , got it . [doctor] correct . yeah , the only thing that they can not have really is diabetes , severe psychiatric disease or schizophrenia , bipolar , things like that . [patient] okay . [doctor] but if they have hypertension , high cholesterol , things like that , they can definitely sign up . [patient] and they can , okay , thank you for explaining that . [doctor] of course , so do you want me to try to get you into that study or would you just like to try me to prescribe you something , it's kinda up to you . [patient] i think i'll just wait for a little bit now . [doctor] alright . sounds good . i'll give you the information for the research . it's just in my office . it is a different phone number though so then if you're interested , just call us within a month because i do n't know how long the , the wait will be . [patient] okay , we will do . [doctor] perfect . so let me go grab your discount card for the unithroid . when you go in to activate it , the instructions are on this card and then you use your insurance . then show them this and ask how much it will cost . if it's too expensive , just let me know . [patient] i will , thank you so much for your help on that . [doctor] you're welcome . then what i did is i gave you a topical antibiotic plus i gave you the benzyl peroxide so the peroxide may bleach your sheets . but you want to make sure to take it and apply it at night so you do n't have a reaction from the sun during the day . [patient] okay , i can do that . [doctor] but you do also want to make sure that you do n't mess up your sheets . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] so that's that and then let's see how you do on the other medications . i think this will , this will get better . in the meantime , a low carb diet , avoid alcohol and fatty foods and low cholesterol foods . [patient] okay . [doctor] and again once you finish your dose of vitamin d for the vitamin d deficiency , you're gon na start with the 2000 international units daily so that you're able to maintain those levels , sound good ? [patient] yes , that sounds great . [doctor] i really think your liver enzymes are gon na get better once you lose the weight though . [patient] okay , that would be great . [doctor] since we stopped your birth control , we can try one called fexie , which is kind of like a spermaside basically . [patient] okay . [doctor] and you just apply it before intercourse . [patient] okay . [doctor] if you need some just let me know . [patient] okay , i will , i will let you know . [doctor] okay , perfect . so stay put for me now . i'm gon na go see if they have a discount samples and bring you that prescription and then i'm going to order the labs for next time . [patient] okay , great . thank you so much . [doctor] you're welcome . so under the plan under abnormal liver enzymes , they have improved since discontinuation of her birth control . under abnormal weight gain , her dexamethasone suppression test was normal , 2 out of 3 solid chorisol tests were normal , not consistent with cushing's and therefore , ruling out cushing's . under her hirsutism , her androgen levels were normal . for the acne vulgaris , the epiduo was not covered , so we will try benzoyl peroxide with clindamycin and remove the previous information on the hypothyroidism . we will print out her prescriptions unithyroid should be better priced with the discount card and we will repeat levels of everything before next visit . thanks .","S (Subjective):

[doctor] hey miss miller , how're you today ? [patient] i'm doing okay , thank you . [doctor] i asked you to come in today because we want to keep , we want you to have this knee surgery this summer but we want to keep a close eye on you to make sure a week before your surgery , you do n't suddenly go into congestive heart failure and it gets postponed . [patient] yeah , that would not be good . [doctor] i see you're scheduled on the 24th for surgery . [patient] yeah , that's right . [doctor] okay , good . well , it looks like you have lost about three , 3-1/2 pounds since i saw you last in april . some of that might be water weight , but still this is positive .

[patient] yeah , i'm , i'm pleased about it too . [doctor] do you ever get leg or finger cramps or any , anything like that ?

[patient] it went away , so i did n't drink anymore . i find it works a lot better than trying to put some cream on my leg . [doctor] sure , just , just keep it in moderation . [patient] okay . [doctor] and then are you still on an iron supplement and are you using the bathroom okay ? [patient] yes everything is good . [doctor] good . how is your heartburn doing ? any problems with that ?

[doctor] alright , let's , let's review your blood work real quick . i checked your hemoglobin level because you have had some anemia in the past , but that is still doing great . [patient] good , that's a relief to hear . [doctor] your potassium is 3.9 , so it's holding steady on the torsemide . your creatinine was 0.7 , 9.8 , so you're doing well with kidney numbers . your your bun . [patient] maybe a tiny bit elevated at 23 which the number we look for for dehydration , sometimes the kidneys , but it's not terrible . [doctor] so when i look at your numbers as a whole , i think you're tolerating the torsemide okay at the current dose . i also sent out to look at the heart failure number . i sent out to look at your heart failure number . [patient] there is a test called a bnp that i was monitoring and in march it was up to 3000 and then went up to 6000 in april before i made the change and i'm still waiting for those results . okay . [doctor] all in all i think you're doing good on paper though . [patient] what about what's it called a1c , does that show up ? [doctor] i do n't think i ordered it , but i could , your last a1c was 5.5 in march . [patient] already . [doctor] so your blood sugar is a little bit high , it was 169 today but that kinda depends on what you ate and you were n't fasting for the blood check , so i might have to repeat that test for preop , but i do n't think we need to do it today . [patient] alrighty , that sounds good . i checked your magnesium level because sometimes you , you urinate out magnesium and with the water pills , but it was normal at 1.7 and your , your blood pressure is also looking good . okay , great . that all sounds awesome . [doctor] alright , let's take a quick listen . use my general physical exam template and take a couple of deep breaths for me . your lungs sound pretty good to me , so keep doing what you're doing like i said , i think you're doing good overall , but let's just talk about a few things . [patient] alrighty . [doctor] so we often like to keep people with heart problems on magnesium , [patient] and get their levels up to around the two–-ish range . yours is a little bit less than two and we want that two–-ish range because because it can help stabilize the heart muscle so i might recommend putting you on a magnesium supplement . it's to be twice a day , so that's kind of annoying . but i know you're on other medicines twice a day too so i think you'll do fine . yeah that will be okay . great now before surgery , we'll have to get you off your clopidogrel for a week beforehand . yes , okay . i have everything written down on my phone and i have a letter taped the side of my bed to remind me . [doctor] perfect . we will give you a reminder as well . we will also need to complete a preop check within 2 weeks after surgery during the first or second week of june . [patient] okay . i'll put that down . you might also have to repeat an ekg before surgery which we could do today . i know i'm sure it feels like you're doing , you're always doing ekg's we do n't need to do any x-rays of your chest because you had one recently and we do n't need anymore blood work because we did that today . yeah , i do a lot of ekgs . i'm basically a regular , but i'm happy to do one today , no problem . [doctor] lastly once we get your knee surgery we , we should think about getting you a colonoscopy . we can do it here locally because you have medicare . do you have private insurance also ? [patient] yeah , i have both . [doctor] okay , so yes , you can get it , your colonoscopy , wherever you'd like . okay , well my husband's insurance may be running out , might we be able to get the procedure done sooner maybe in the next 30 days , is that okay ? [patient] i could put it in right now for for county for the next 30 days and then might be able to get you in within the next few weeks . it should not take it should not make you an eligible for the surgery . in other words , completing the colonoscopy would not delay your surgery . [doctor] okay good . [patient] so let me see , i've been doing one of two things and everyone , and everyone is great , so it depends more on timing and availability of their or for the colonoscopy we can send you to dr. martin for the surgery who is at county surgical services down here or the other option is valley medical and they do it at springfield . [doctor] okay that sounds good . [patient] i think either direction they are good technicians of the colon okay , yeah , whatever you can get me in , that works great . [doctor] so i'll call around , now if you get that done and they tell you 10 years , then you'll be good to go . [patient] great , thank you . [doctor] you're welcome . have a great day and let us know if you need anything else , okay . [patient] sounds good . alright assessment and plan , chronic chf , mixed presentation , had a exacerbation of cf chf earlier in the spring , we switched her from a furosemide to torsemide and symptomatically she is doing a lot better . she's about three , 3-1/2 pounds down in weight . breathing is nonlabored , and going to repeat ekg today , but otherwise continue her current regimen . labs checked and creatinine is appropriate . # 2 , preop examination , she is , she is having a , a right knee replacement end of june . also , she would like to have a colonoscopy performed , which we will try to have done at county hospital in the next month prior to a change in her insurance . this is just a screening colonoscopy that she is overdue for . no family history of colon cancer . the next one is . [doctor] diabetes . a1c is 5.1 on the last check , so no need for further a1c today . she may need another one prior to her surgery next month though . thanks .","S (Subjective):

virtscribe_nan_VS011,"[doctor] patrick allen , date of birth 7/7/1977 . new patient visit . past medical history includes gerd , anxiety , depression , here for chronic abdominal pain , he had an abdominal ct on 1/23/2020 . impression is a normal ct of the abdomen . hello , are you mr. allen ? [patient] yes , i am . [doctor] hi , my name is dr. edwards , nice to meet you . [patient] nice to meet you . [doctor] welcome to the gi specialty clinic . [patient] thank you . [doctor] did you have any problems finding this ? [patient] no , i've been here with my sister once before . [doctor] good , so how can i help you today ? the referral i have is for abdominal pain and diarrhea . [patient] right so i've had been having this pain right here in my stomach like right around here . [doctor] so in the area of your mid abdomen just below the belly button ? [patient] correct . i've had the pain on and off for about 2 years . i finally went to the er and a a few months ago and they did a ct scan . [doctor] i saw that . [patient] yeah , they said they did n't really see anything on the scan . [doctor] yes , i agree , it looked normal . [patient] and the problem is i'm either constipated or have explosive diarrhea . [doctor] is the pain there all the time ? [patient] it's a nagging feeling and it just depends , sometimes it bothers me , sometimes it does n't . [doctor] has this been the case over the past 2 years as well ? [patient] more recently in the past couple of months at least with the constipation and diarrhea . [doctor] and before that , how were your bowel movements ? [patient] they were normal . [doctor] okay , so any blood in your stool ? [patient] nope . [doctor] do you feel like you have more constipation or diarrhea ? [patient] probably more constipation . [doctor] okay , so when you're constipated , do you not have a bowel movement or is the stool hard ? [patient] i usually do n't go , but when i do , it's hard . [doctor] and how often do you have a bowel movement when you are constipated ? [patient] about 3-4 times a week it's like when i need to go to the bathroom if i can massage it , it feels like it's moving some and i can eventually go . [doctor] okay and when you have a bowel movement , does the pain change ? [patient] yeah . it gets a little better . [doctor] and are you eating and drinking okay , any nausea or vomiting , heartburn or indigestion ? [patient] none of that . [doctor] okay , so tell me about the diarrhea . how often do you get it ? [patient] it kinda just depends on what i eat . i think i have a very sensitive stomach if i eat pasta with a creamy sauce i'm probably gon na have diarrhea . [doctor] okay and does it happen for multiple days in a row or is it just one time ? [patient] it's usually just one time and then it's over . [doctor] and how has your weight been , any fluctuation ? [patient] no , it's been pretty stable , although i could stand to lose about 25 pounds . [doctor] okay , and is there any family history of gi issues that you know of ? [patient] not that i can think of . well , actually my sister does have problems with her stomach too . she has irritable bowel syndrome and that is kind of what i always thought i had even though i have never been diagnosed with it . [doctor] okay and is there any family history of gi cancer or liver disease ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you ever had any surgeries on your abdomen ? [patient] i have never had any surgery . [doctor] okay , so your gallbladder , appendix , all of those are still intact ? [patient] yep . [doctor] and have you ever had a colonoscopy ? [patient] no . i thought that happened when you turned 50 . [doctor] well that's for colon cancer screening , but there are other reasons to have a colonoscopy like unexplained abdominal pain and changes in bowel habits . [patient] okay . [doctor] well , come have a seat here and lay back so i can examine you . [patient] okay . [doctor] i'm gon na start by listening to your belly with my stethoscope . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i hear bowel sounds in all four quadrants . [patient] what does that mean , is everything okay ? [doctor] it just means that i can hear little noises in all areas of your belly , which means your bowels are active and working . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so now i'm going to push on your upper and lower abdomen , let me know if you have any pain . [patient] it hurts a little when you push right there on the left side near my belly button . [doctor] okay , i do feel stool in your lower colon which would coincide with constipation but i also feel a slight enlargement of your liver here on the upper right side . have you had any lab work done recently ? [patient] yes . i had a physical about 4 months ago and they i had blood drawn then . [doctor] okay and did your primary care physician say anything about the lab results ? [patient] he said i had some very slightly elevated liver enzymes but we would recheck them in about 6 months . [doctor] and do you remember what enzymes were elevated , alt , ast , alp ? [patient] he said the alt and the ast were elevated . [doctor] and do you take any medications either prescription or over the counter ? [patient] i take crestor and , and olmesartan daily and then tylenol for occasional , occasional pain . [doctor] and how frequently do you take the tylenol ? [patient] hardly ever , maybe once a month . [doctor] and do you consume alcohol ? [patient] yes , but only a couple of beers after working in the yard on saturdays . [doctor] okay and no previous history of heavy alcohol or drug use ? [patient] no . [doctor] and have you had any recent issues with excessive bruising or bleeding ? [patient] nope . [doctor] and how about any issues with your ankles or feet swelling ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay , i'm gon na take a look at your eyes and skin . i do n't see any jaundice . [patient] what would cause that ? [doctor] issues with your liver . let me take a quick listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] lungs are clear bilateral . heart sounds are normal . no murmurs , gallops , or rubs noted . [patient] that's good . [doctor] yes , the rest of your physical exam is normal other than what seems to be an increased stool burden in your colon and a slight hepatomegaly . [patient] what's that ? [doctor] increased stool burden means that there is a lot of stool sitting in your colon . [patient] and that's the constipation , right ? but what about the other thing ? [doctor] the hepatomegaly means the liver is enlarged . [patient] but you said mom was slightly enlarged . [doctor] correct . [patient] so what does that mean ? [doctor] well , let's talk about what we found and then some possible next steps if you're in agreement . [patient] okay . [doctor] so as i said , the hepatomegaly means your liver is enlarged . [patient] could that be why my stomach is hurting and i'm having issues with the constipation and diarrhea ? [doctor] no , i think you're constipated and have occasional bouts of diarrhea because of certain foods you eat and we can get you started right away on a fiber supplement that should help with that . [patient] so what about my liver , why is it enlarged ? [doctor] well , there are many reasons why people can have an elevated liver enzymes and also an enlarged liver . some possible causes are certain medications that can be toxic to the liver . alcohol abuse , fatty liver disease , hepatitis , cirrhosis , and other liver diseases like wilson's disease . [patient] so what do i need to do ? [doctor] well , i think since it's been about 4 months since your blood work was done , we should check your liver enzymes in addition to a few other labs . [patient] okay and then what ? [doctor] we will get those drawn today and then depending upon the results , you may need an ultrasound of your liver . i think we need to talk about your medications too . [patient] which medications ? [doctor] crestor , how long have you been taking that ? [patient] about 18 months . [doctor] okay , well crestor is one of the medications that can cause liver toxicity , so it may be a good idea to discuss other alternatives . [patient] should i talk to my primary care or can you change it ? [doctor] i would recommend calling your primary care and discuss that with him since he follows you for your blood pressure and cholesterol . [patient] okay . i'll call him this afternoon . [doctor] great . i also think we should go ahead and get you scheduled for a liver ultrasound . if your blood work looks good , then we can always cancel that . [patient] okay . when do you think i'll be able to get the ultrasound done ? [doctor] hopefully within the next 2 weeks , you will receive a call from the radiology scheduling this afternoon to get it set up . [patient] okay and then what happens ? [doctor] when i get the results from the tests , i'll contact you and depending upon what we find , we'll come up with our next steps . [patient] and when should i see you again ? [doctor] let's schedule an appointment when you check out to return in 4 weeks . we'll discuss how you're doing with the fiber supplement and your constipation and review test results to determine if we need to do further testing on your liver . [patient] okay . is there anything else i can do to help with these issues ? [doctor] definitely refrain from drinking any alcohol , increase your water intake to at least 48 ounces a day , in addition to taking the fiber supplement to help with your constipation and be mindful of eating foods that you are sensitive to so you can avoid the bouts of diarrhea . [patient] okay and i will talk to my primary care about my crestor . [doctor] excellent and do you have any other questions for me ? [patient] i do n't think so . [doctor] great . so remember when you check out at the front desk , schedule a follow-up appointment with me for 4 weeks and then go to the lab to get your blood work drawn . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] and expect a call from radiology scheduling about setting up your ultrasound . [patient] alright . thanks dr. edwards .

[doctor] on the testicle or the epididymis ? [patient] epididymis . i really do n't know . i'm not super concerned or read a little online , just wanted to ask you . [doctor] and did you have a vasectomy ? [patient] no . let me pull my notes out and make sure i mentioned everything i wanted to tell you . those are the only things and it's not like my tiredness is depression or anything . i'm a pretty happy guy overall , you know . i just know you would ask those questions .

[patient] it varies usually i get 6 to 7 hours of sleep , i get out of bed some days to be at work by seven lecture and i try to work out in the morning . i i do n't , i'm not , i'm not really successful and now what i do is i , i do make reservations twice a week for 545 swim in the morning . [doctor] okay , so you're getting 6 to 7 hours of sleep and has your wife ever mentioned if you snore or stop breathing at any time ? [patient] i believe i snore a little bit , but she has never said anything about me not breathing . [doctor] okay . so you're currently taking vitamin d3 around 5000 units on sundays and 2000 or 50,000 units on sundays excuse me and 2000 on the other 6 days and then clindamycin prior to dental procedures correct .

[patient] alright . [doctor] also your recent labs showed an elevated alkaline phosphatase level at 156 now this could be related to your liver but most likely related to your bone health we are going to check a few labs today .

[doctor] yes sir and we will send the results through your patient portal unless something is way off and will give you a call sounds good now as far as your breathing i observe the pursed lip breathing and your exhalation is low i think you should do a pulmonary function test to further evaluate and i would evaluate as well now the nodule in your right testicle should be evaluated by urology and we will place that referral today also .

virtscribe_nan_VS026,"[doctor] donna torres , date of birth 8/1/1980 . hi donna , how are you ? [patient] i'm good , how about you ? [doctor] i'm doing well , thank you and so i saw that doctor brown put you on buspar . have you been on that before ? [patient] no , that's new . [doctor] okay . how is it working for you ? [patient] my anxiety's going good now . thankfully , i'm serious . it was brutal in november and december . finally , i was like i can not do this . i have no idea why it happened . dr. ward did put me on singulair , she did say we need to be careful because singulair can cause anxiety , so i'm not sure if that was the issue or what . [doctor] hmmm okay . [patient] and i would start usually during the day at work . [doctor] i see . [patient] i mean i'm fine now . [doctor] well , that's good that things have settled . i do wonder if some of what you were dealing with is hormonal and that's why i was asking because you were on the progesterone and i feel like you were having some irritability back then too . [patient] i did . [doctor] and that was before we started the progesterone . [patient] yes . [doctor] so i know we started for regulating your periods , but perhaps it helped with this also . [patient] yeah , and before in november and december , i noticed that the week before my period , my anxiety would go through the roof , which then i knew my period was coming , then it turned into my anxiety spiking , just at random times . [doctor] hmmm okay . [patient] and it seemed like it was for no reason . [doctor] but november and december you were on the progesterone at that time . [patient] yes . [doctor] alright , so not really a link there , alright . [patient] yeah , i do n't know . [doctor] yeah , i do n't know either . sometimes with the aging process , that can happen too . [patient] i figured maybe that's what it was . [doctor] and we did go through the go live in november and december so that can be pretty stressful also . [patient] yeah and that worked and that's when i first started to leave the process of delivering the results to patients with covid in the beginning of the whole pandemic , patients would have to wait 9 days before they get their results and then we open the evaluation centers and the covid clinic , so i think it just took a toll on me . [doctor] yeah , i can absolutely see that . [patient] yeah and then i was feeling selfish because i was n't even on the front lines i mean i was supporting people sure but i was n't in the icu so i felt selfish and guilty i mean hands down , the physicians and nurses were in the thick of it and there i was having anxiety and it's not ridiculous . [doctor] well , honestly you feel how you feel and what you were doing was n't easy as well , so but let's see , i need to just put this dax back to work . alright . so no other issues whatsoever ? [patient] no . [doctor] have you lost weight ? [patient] no , when i stopped taking the camilla birth control , my hunger level was at a new high . i mean i was eating constantly . i felt like what was going on . [doctor] alright . [patient] and now i am feeling better . [doctor] okay . that's good . and your mask face though , it does look thinner . [patient] well , in the past 6 months , i have lost some weight . [doctor] okay , good . anything else going on ? [patient] no . [doctor] alright . so your pap was in 2019 . i do n't think that we need to repeat that because it was negative , negative . have you ever had an abnormal pap ? [patient] not with you , but i did around 2009 and then i had to be seen every 6 months for a while and then i had a normal pap . [doctor] alright , well let's just repeat it then . [patient] yeah , that's fine with me to be safe . [doctor] okay . i know it sounds superstitious , but i feel like with all the immunocompromising , the pressure , the stress that people's bodies have been under and the potential for getting covid , or the vaccine , i have actually seen some an increase in abnormal paps in people who have been fine for a while , so that's why i figure let's just check . [patient] okay . and i fight the vaccine fight every day at home because my husband is n't ready to get it , same with my daughter . she shares the same worries as her dad and how will it impact her when she gets older . [doctor] have you had the vaccine ? [patient] yes , i have and so has my son , he has had his first already . [doctor] okay , well , you know you can only do what you can do . [patient] yeah , i agree . [doctor] alright , well , let's complete your exam . [patient] alright . [doctor] so let's take a deep breath , and again alright you can breathe normally . [patient] alright and take one more deep breath , [doctor] okay , now i'm gon na touch your neck . go ahead and swallow . perfect and just place your hand above your head okay , i do feel some little bumps . [patient] yeah , but they are not as big as they were . [doctor] mm-hmm . okay , in this breast , it does feel a little bit denseer . does it hurt at all ? [patient] it does where your left hand just was . [doctor] okay , right here ? [patient] yeah , down here , but whenever i breast-fed , it was always sore there too , i had a clog and something else , the lumps do feel smaller , but they are still there unfortunately . [doctor] yeah , they are , well now i do n't know because if it was the progesterone , they would have gone away . [patient] yeah . [doctor] alright , well just let your knees just relax and open . how's the itching or discomfort ? are you still using the cream ? [patient] yes and i actually need to get that refilled for the first time ever . [doctor] okay . [patient] but yeah , i use it once a week and it does help . [doctor] okay , great . alright , looks good . [patient] good . [doctor] you can go ahead and sit up . [patient] thank you . [doctor] alright , so typically the lumps would often just shrink up pretty quickly after you've had one or two cycles and you've had two cycles so far . so i think let's just keep monitoring them for now . [patient] okay . and what could that mean ? [doctor] well , so just like people have an increased risk of breast cancer , there is also an increased risk for breast issues . you know what i mean ? so for example , cyst . and lumps and fibroadenomas . those are all benign things . they are annoying and requires some work-up , but they are all benign . [patient] and i'm , i'm just worried because i'm almost full . 40 and my mom was almost 45 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer , so i mean i know there is nothing i can do about it but it's just i feel like we had it under control and now it is n't . [doctor] well i would n't say that . i mean i feel like we're at a point where we have a good cadence for you having surveillance on things and i think you are more aware of your breasts than ever before and things actually have n't changed . [patient] yeah . [doctor] so those are all good things . [patient] okay . [doctor] because if it was cancer , it would actually we would see some change . [patient] it would , okay . thank you for explaining that . [doctor] yeah . so i know it's annoying and distressing . but i think that's where we're at . it's annoying that you have the breast issue and it's annoying that we have to follow them . [patient] yeah , i agree there . [doctor] but the only extra that i could potentially do is we could get a breast specialist on the team and have you start to follow with them and one of the advantages there is that they sometimes will do an ultrasound as an extension of their physical exam in the office to check out , check it out on their own . they also have a lot more experience and more willingness to sometimes perform procedures earlier if they think it needs if they think it needs to be done . and i think they tend to be much quicker than you know like radiology is to biopsy it . [patient] okay . i'll do whatever you think i should . [doctor] alright . well , i think since you're feeling worried , let's go ahead and we can get them on board . i'll send out a referral and they will call you within the next couple of business days to schedule . [patient] okay , i think that sounds great . [doctor] alright , i do too . alright , well any questions or anything else we can discuss today ? [patient] no , i think i'm all set . [doctor] alright , good . alright , well have a good rest of your day and just give us a call if you need anything else . [patient] alright , thank you . you have a good day too .

[patient] sounds good . [doctor] great so i have that you were found to have a calcification in your right breast during a mammogram in october 2019 . was that just a normal screening mammogram or was it done because you felt a lump ? it was just a normal one , you were supposed to get every so often . i see and then it looks like you had an ultrasound of your right breast on november 3 , 2019 which revealed a mass at the 2 o'clock position 11 cm from the nipple in the retroareolar region . the report states the mass was . [patient] 0.4 x 2 x 3 cm . [doctor] yes , that sounds right , hard to remember now though . [patient] yeah , definitely . [doctor] based on those results , they decided to do an ultrasound-guided core needle biopsy on december 5 , 2019 . pathology results during that biopsy came back as grade 2 , er positive , pr positive dcis , [patient] or ductal carcinoma in situ . [doctor] yes unfortunately . i know scary stuff but you had a lumpectomy on january 20 , 2020 which removed the 8 mm tumor and margins were negative .

[doctor] yeah , i was definitely very relieved . and your last mammogram was in january 2021 and that was normal . [patient] yeah . [doctor] okay . so i feel like i have a good grasp of what's been going on with you now and you're here today to establish .

[doctor] okay , so for the record that's g5 , p5 . and now that you're postmenopausal , are you currently or have you ever been on hormone replacement therapy ? [patient] my primary care doctor gave me the option years ago , but i decided against it . [doctor] okay . and on your review of systems form , you indicated that you've not had any recent weight loss , or gain , headaches , bone pain , urinary symptoms , or blood in the stools , but you did indicate that you have some back pain , joint pain , and high cholesterol . tell me some more about those . okay . so i've seen doctors for all of those . they said excuse me , the back and knee pain are age related and the cholesterol is a fairly new diagnosis . but i am working on exercise and cutting back on fatty foods to see if i can get it lower without any medication . okay and your primary care doctor is following you for that right ? [patient] that's correct . [doctor] okay . for medications , i have that you take coq10 , vitamin d , vitamin c , fish oil , and elderberry fruit , is that alright ? [patient] yes and that's all . [doctor] okay . so for your medical history , it's high cholesterol and stage 0 , er , pr positive , invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . any surgeries other than the lumpectomy ? [patient] i did have my tubes tied after my last baby , but that's all . [doctor] okay and how about family history ?

[doctor] i did . we also talked about endocrine therapy , but i decided against that . okay . so your exam looks good . no masses , just some skin changes from that radiation . now let's go over the plan for you . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] as you know you had dcis which will list in my note is stage 0 er/pr positive invasive ductal carcinoma of the right breast . you're status post lumpectomy with removal of five lymph nodes that were benign . you also had radiation therapy , but declined endocrine therapy . today's clinical examination shows no evidence of recurrence with the dcis or other malignancy . [patient] and your mammogram in january 2021 was also negative for recurrence of malignancy . so based on all of that , we can just continue to observe you . [doctor] okay , that sounds great and when do i come back in to see you ? in a year , but you should have another mammogram in april 2022 before you come back to see me . [patient] okay . i can do that . [doctor] wonderful . i'm glad to see you doing so well . do you have any questions or concerns i can address for you today ? [patient] i do n't think so .

virtscribe_nan_VS028,"[doctor] next patient is sophia jackson , mrnr 472348 . she is a 57-year-old female who is here for a surgical consult . [patient] her dermatologist referred her . she biopsied a 0.7 mm lesion which was located on the right inferior back . pathology came back as melanoma . [doctor] mrs. jackson , it's good to meet you . [patient] likewise , wish you were under better circumstances . [doctor] yeah , i heard your dermatologist sent you to because she found the melanoma . [patient] yes , that's what the biopsy said . [doctor] okay and when did you first notice the spot ? [patient] my mom noticed it when i was visiting her last month . [doctor] i see and so you went to the dermatologist on april 10 to get it checked out , right ? [patient] yes , i wanted to be extra cautious because skin cancer does run in my family . [doctor] well i'm really glad you took a serious and got it checked . who in your family has had skin cancer and do you know if it was melanoma or was it basal cell or squamous cell ? [patient] my mom and her sister i think they both had melanoma . [doctor] okay . do you have any other types of cancer in the family like breast or ovarian ? [patient] my grandfather had pancreatic cancer . [doctor] okay and what about your mom or dad's father ? [patient] mother's . [doctor] okay and have you personally had any skin spots in the past that you got checked out and they were cancerous or precancerous ? [patient] no , this was the first time i've been to a dermatologist but my primary care doctor looks over all of my moles every year . my physical and has n't said he is concerned about any of them before . [doctor] good , good . let's go over your medical history here in your chart . i have that you are not taking any medications and do n't have any health problems listed , but that you are allergic to augmentin , is that right ? [patient] yes , that's correct . [doctor] okay and for social history , can you tell me what you do for work ? [patient] i own an auto repair shop . okay and have you ever been a smoker ? yeah , i still smoke from time to time . i started that awful habit in my teens and it's hard to break , but i'm trying . [doctor] i'm glad you're trying to quit . what about your surgical history ? have you had any surgeries ? [patient] i had gallbladder and appendix . [doctor] okay , great . we can get your chart up to date now , thank you . and other than the melanoma , how has your health been ? any unintentional weight changes , headaches , fatigue , nausea , vomiting , vision changes ? [patient] no , i've been feeling great . [doctor] good . well , let me take a look at your back here where they did the biopsy if you do n't mind . [patient] sure . [doctor] okay . i'm gon na describe it in medical jargon , what i'm seeing here so that the recording can capture it , but you and i are gon na go over it together in just a moment , okay ? [patient] okay , that's fine . [doctor] alright , so on the right inferior back , there is a 1 cm shave biopsy site including all of the dermis with no residual pigmentation there is no intrinsic or satellite lesions . no other suspicious moles . no axillary , cervical or supraclavicular lymphadenopathy . there is a soft lymph node in the right groin but it's nontender . otherwise normal exam . [patient] okay , you can sit up . so what i was saying there is that i see your biopsy site , but i do n't see any other skin lumps or bumps that look suspicious . [doctor] i also felt your lymph nodes to see if any of them felt abnormal . there is one in the right groin that felt slightly abnormal . it's very likely nothing , but i do want you to have an ultrasound of that area to confirm it's nothing . and you know make sure it's something we need to worry about the reason we are being extra cautious is that melanoma can very rarely metastasize to the lymph nodes . the ultrasound can tell us if we need to look into this further . [patient] okay . i should have worried too much then . [doctor] no , i have a low suspicion that it will show anything . [patient] okay , good . [doctor] so assuming that the ultrasound is normal . the treatment for your melanoma is to cut out the area where the lesion was . with lesions that are 0.7 mm or less and that's what we recommend and yours was exactly 0.7 mm . if it were any bigger , we would have had to do a more complex surgery , but what i recommend for you is what we call a wide local incision , excuse me , excision meaning that i will make a long incision and then cut out an area a bit wider than your current biopsy site . the incision is long because that's what allows me to close the skin nicely . you'll have a fairly long scar from the incision . [patient] okay , that is fine with me . i ca n't see back there anyways . [doctor] yeah , your wife can tell you what it looks like and she may need to help care for the incision at it as it heals . but since we're we are n't doing the more complex surgery , i actually do n't need to see you back unless you wan na check in with me or have any problems , however , it is very important that you continue to follow up with your dermatologist regularly , so she can monitor you . your dermatologist will check if this one does n't come back , but she will also check for other lesions that look suspicious . unfortunately since you had one melanoma , you are at a higher risk of developing another one somewhere else . [patient] yeah , she did say she wants to see me back . [doctor] good and i'm sure she has already told you , but it's very important that you apply sunscreen anytime and anywhere that your skin is exposed to sunlight . [patient] yeah , she definitely went over that several times with me . [doctor] good . other than that , i think that's all for me . we'll get you set up for the ultrasound and the procedure . do you have any questions for me ? [patient] no , i ca n't think of any at this time . [doctor] okay . my nurse will be in to get you scheduled . so sit tight . it was very good to meet you .

virtscribe_nan_VS029,"[doctor] this is philip gutierrez date of birth 1/12/1971 . he is a 50-year-old male here for a second opinion regarding the index finger on the right hand . [patient] he had a hyperextension injury of that index finger during a motor vehicle accident in march of this year . he was offered an injection of the a1 pulley region , but did not want any steroid because of the reaction to dexamethasone , which causes his heart to race . [doctor] he was scheduled to see dr. alice davis , which it does n't appear he did . he had an mri of that finger because there was concern about a capsular strain plus or minus rupture of fds tendon end . [patient] he has been seen at point may orthopedics largely by the physical therapy staff and a pr pa at that institution . at that practice , an mri was obtained on 4/24/2021 . [doctor] which showed just focal soft tissue swelling over the right index mcp joint partial thickness tear of the right fds and fluid consistent with tenosynovitis around the fdp and fds tendons . radial and ulnar collateral ligaments of the index mcp joint were intact as the mcp joint capsule . extensor tendons also deemed intact . his x-rays four views of the right hand today show no bony abnormalities , joint congruency throughout all lesser digits on the right hand . no soft tissue shadows of concern . no arthritis . hi , how are you mr . gutierrez ? i'm good how about you ? [patient] well how can i help you today ? so i was a passenger in a car that was rear-ended and we were hit multiple times i felt two bumps which slugged me forward and caused me to stretch out my right index finger . [doctor] so hitting the car in front of you all made that finger go backwards ? [patient] i do n't really know , i just felt like it felt like i laid on my finger and so i felt like it went back and it's been hurting since about march and it's been like that ever , ever since the wreck happened , so i and i ca n't make a fist but sometimes the pain is unbearable and like even driving hurts . [doctor] okay . so this was march of this year , so maybe about 3 months ago ? [patient] yeah . and it's still swollen . so i was seeing an orthopedist and they sent me to an occupational therapist and i've been doing therapy with them and then they sent me to go back and get an mri , so i went and got the mri then they told me that the mri came back . and i said i had a tear in my finger , but he was n't gon na give me an injection because the injection was going to make the tear worse . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] and then after he got the mri he said that i have a tear in my finger and that he did n't want to do surgery , but he would do an injection . then i'm thinking that you told me you would n't do an injection in there and then the occupational therapy says it's because of the tear , and then they do n't want me to keep rubbing the thing and doing things with my hand , so i feel like i'm not getting medical care really . [doctor] hmmm yeah , i see that . [patient] so i came to see if you could do anything for this hand because i am right handed and i kinda need that hand . [doctor] mm-hmm what do you do for a living ? [patient] i'm an x-ray tech . [doctor] wow so do you have any diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis ? [patient] nope . do you take any chronic medications of significance ? [doctor] i do take a blood pressure pill and that's it . [patient] okay and it looks like you suffer from itching with the methyl prednisone ? [doctor] that's correct . alright , well , i'm gon na scoot up closer and just take a quick look at your hand . alright , so lean over here . alright , so on this exam today , we have a very pleasant , cooperative , healthy male , no distress . his heart rate is regular rate , rhythm , 2+ radial pulse . no swelling or bruise , bruising in the palm over the volar surface of his index finger . normal creases , slightly diminished over the tip of the index finger compared to the middle finger . [patient] his index finger rest in a 10 degree pip flexed position alright , is that uncomfortable to correct that and is it uncomfortable now here ? [doctor] yeah when you push on it , yeah . [patient] alright , how about here ? there it's not . [doctor] okay , not as bad . [patient] yeah , it feels little numb . [doctor] gotcha , alright , bend , bend the tip of this finger , bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , keep bending , alright , straighten it out , [patient] alright , and now bend it for me as best you can . my goodness , feels like it's it's tearing in there . okay , okay . well , bend the tip of this finger and bend it as hard as you can , keep bending , alright , straighten that out and now bend it for me as best as you can , [doctor] alright , good . now bend that finger and i'm going to pull , put it down like this and then bend that finger for me , okay , sorry , can you bend it for me ? alright , now make a fist , great , so relax the finger , alright , so just keep it , keep when i bend the finger , we're just going to bend that finger where it meets the hand , is that okay there ? [patient] ow , ah . [doctor] okay , okay , so all the hurt it seems is stretching because you have n't been doing this for so long , so you know what i mean so you're going to have to start really doing that . [patient] well , i've tried , i even bought myself a splint . [doctor] well , but a splint does n't help move you , it actually immobilizes you . [patient] okay , i thought it would straighten it out . [doctor] no , no , so , so you really need to start bending the finger right here for me as hard as you can and keep going , going , alright , so , so you're okay . alright , so i would say the following that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons . there is the fdp and the fds and the fds is the least important of the two . so the mri shows that it's the fds the flexor digitorum , superficialis which is the least important of the two . [patient] okay . [doctor] now there are two halves of it , so it's the partial tear of one half of a whole tendon . that's not that important and the other one is just fine . so the good one is good ? [patient] yes , correct . so the one that goes all the way to the tip is good . [doctor] okay , good . [patient] yeah , so you know i think what you have got so much scar tissue and inflammation around the fds tendon , [doctor] blocking excursion of these other tendons that they ca n't get through to the pulley . [patient] okay . alright . [doctor] so what i would recommend what we try is a cortisone injection and i would avoid the dexamethasone because i saw you have a little reaction to that . but we could use the betamethasone which is a sellastone i've gotten another methylprednisolone and that itching like crazy . [patient] did it , yeah , this one is water soluble and i think it's fairly low toxicity , but high benefit and i think decreasing the pain will encourage you to move that finger . [doctor] alright , we'll give it a try . good . so you do the shot and it's going to take about 3 to 5 days before it starts feeling better and then probably over the next couple of weeks , it'll start feeling even better . [patient] perfect . [doctor] alright , so take advantage of that . you got ta start moving the finger . you're not gon na tear anything or break a bone because your intensors , extensors are intact . but your collateral ligaments are intact , so you got a sore finger . i'm going to try to help as much as i can with this soreness part and then you have to do all the stiff part . [patient] the lady in occupational therapy tried some maneuvers to straighten the finger out , but it even hurt after i left . the whole thing just swelled up . [doctor] hmmm okay . so it was injured and you had scar tissue and then you had posttraumatic inflammation and so this will help some with all of that . it's not going to make it to where your finger is like my finger does n't hurt at all , but it will make it to where at least tolerable to where you can make some gains and we actually might need to repeat this as well . [patient] well i'll be able to drive , i drove myself here today so . [doctor] yeah , it may feel a little weird , but it's totally safe for you to drive . okay , good . [patient] so for mr . gutierrez , just put that he has a posttraumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of his right index finger . [doctor] and the plan is steroid injection today , do a trigger injection , but i'm using a cc of betamethasone . so mr . gutierrez , do you have therapy scheduled or set up ? [patient] not at the moment . [doctor] alright , well , i mean you know that you need to move that finger and i think to the degree that they can help you do that . so , i want you to move that finger finger , but i think it would be beneficial for you to have an accountability . [patient] so at least you know to check in with them once a week with somebody . [doctor] okay that's kinda why i'm here for you , tell me what needs to be done , you know . [patient] yeah , so i'll write you out , [doctor] an outpatient prescription . i think if you go back to the same people where you were before , i'm hoping that after this injection , you're going to be able to do a whole lot more with them . so let's do outpatient , once a week for 6 weeks , [patient] and then full active and passive range of motion is the goal with no restrictions . [doctor] alright sounds like a plan . [patient] alright , well i will have the nurse set up the injection procedure and we'll and i'll be back shortly . [doctor] thanks document . right trigger finger injection template , attempted to inject 1 cc of celestone with half a cc of lidocaine however , the patient had a dramatic and violent , painful reaction to the introduction of the needle with contortions of the hand and with dangerously withdrawing the hand with concerns for secondary needle stick . needle was withdrawn . the patient was counseled as to the importance of attempting to get some therapeutic steroid in the flexor tendon sheath . we attempted a second time for a similar injection using the same technique with 1 cc of celestone and half a cc of lidocaine . [patient] a small palmar vein bled a scant amount , which was cleaned up and band-aid applied . reassured on multiple occasions that no harm was done to his finger . recommended icing and it this evening and taking ibuprofen .","S (Subjective):

X-rays of the right hand showed no concerning soft tissue shadows.

X-rays of the right hand showed no arthritis.

The patient was previously offered an injection in the A1 pulley region of the right index finger.

The patient declined a steroid injection previously because dexamethasone causes his heart to race.

The patient reports a reaction to dexamethasone that causes his heart to race.

The patient reports itching with methylprednisolone.

The patient takes a blood pressure pill.

The patient denies having diabetes.

The patient denies having rheumatoid arthritis.

On exam, the patient appeared healthy and in no distress.

On exam, the patient had a regular heart rate and rhythm.

On exam, the patient had a 2+ radial pulse.

On exam, there was no swelling or bruising in the palm over the volar surface of the right index finger.

On exam, the skin creases were normal but slightly diminished over the tip of the right index finger compared to the middle finger.

On exam, the right index finger rested in a 10-degree PIP flexed position.

The patient reported discomfort when the right index finger was corrected from the flexed position.

The patient reported that the right index finger felt a little numb.

The clinician assessed that there is a partial tear in one of the two flexor tendons of the right index finger.

The clinician stated that the MRI shows a partial tear of one half of the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon of the right index finger.

The clinician stated that the flexor digitorum profundus tendon to the tip of the right index finger is intact.

The clinician stated that there is scar tissue and inflammation around the flexor digitorum superficialis tendon of the right index finger.

The clinician diagnosed the patient with posttraumatic rather severe stenosing tenosynovitis of the right index finger.

The clinician recommended a cortisone injection for the right index finger.

The clinician planned to avoid dexamethasone for the injection because of the patient’s prior reaction.

The clinician planned to use betamethasone (Celestone) for the injection.

The clinician informed the patient that the injection may take 3 to 5 days before it starts feeling better.

The clinician informed the patient that the finger may continue to improve over the next couple of weeks after the injection.

The clinician advised the patient to start moving the right index finger more.

The clinician told the patient that he is not going to tear anything or break a bone by moving the finger because the extensor tendons are intact.

The clinician told the patient that the collateral ligaments of the right index finger are intact.

The patient reported that maneuvers performed in occupational therapy to straighten the finger caused pain and swelling afterward.

The clinician explained that the finger was injured with scar tissue and posttraumatic inflammation.

The clinician stated that the steroid injection is intended to make the pain more tolerable so the patient can make gains in motion.

The clinician stated that the steroid injection might need to be repeated.

The plan included a steroid trigger finger injection using 1 cc of betamethasone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine.

The plan included outpatient therapy once a week for six weeks.

The therapy goal is full active and passive range of motion of the right index finger with no restrictions.

During the first injection attempt, the patient had a dramatic and violent painful reaction to the introduction of the needle.

During the first injection attempt, the patient’s hand contorted and he withdrew the hand dangerously, raising concern for secondary needle stick.

The needle was withdrawn after the first injection attempt.

The patient was counseled about the importance of attempting to get therapeutic steroid into the flexor tendon sheath.

A second injection attempt was made using the same technique with 1 cc of Celestone and 0.5 cc of lidocaine.

During the injection procedure, a small palmar vein bled a scant amount.

The bleeding from the small palmar vein was cleaned and a band-aid was applied.

The patient was reassured multiple times that no harm was done to his finger.

The patient was advised to ice the finger that evening.

The patient was advised to take ibuprofen."

virtscribe_nan_VS032,"[doctor] dictating on donald clark date of birth 03/04/1937 . chief complaint is left arm pain . hello , how are you ? [patient] good morning . [doctor] it's nice to meet you . i'm dr. miller . [patient] it's nice to meet you as well . [doctor] so i hear you are having pain in this arm , is that correct ? [patient] that's correct . [doctor] okay and it seems like it's worse at night ? [patient] well right now the hand is . [doctor] mm-hmm . [patient] and the thing started about 2 weeks ago , i woke up about 2:00 in the morning and it was just hurting something awful . [doctor] uh uh . [patient] and then i laid some ice on it and it finally did ease up . [doctor] okay , that's good . [patient] so i got up , i sat on the side of the bed and held my arm down thinking it would like help the circulation , but it did n't . [doctor] okay , i see . [patient] and so after a while when it eased off maybe about four or 5 am i laid back down and it did n't start up again . [doctor] mm-hmm okay . [patient] i went back to sleep but for several nights this happened like over and over , so i finally went to see the doctor and i do n't really recall her name . [doctor] okay . yeah , i think i know who you're talking about though . [patient] she is the one who sent me to you , so i , i would , i would think so , but when i went to her after the third time it happened , then she checked me out , she said it was most likely coming from a pinched nerve , [doctor] probably do you notice that moving your neck or turning your head seems to bother your arm ? [patient] no . [doctor] okay . is moving your shoulder uncomfortable at all ? [patient] no . [doctor] and do you notice it at other times besides during the night ? [patient] some days if it bothers me at night , then the day following it usually will bother me some . [doctor] okay and do you just notice it in the hand or does it seem to be going down the whole arm ? [patient] well it starts there and goes all the way down the arm . [doctor] okay . have you noticed any weakness in your hand at all ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay like in terms of gripping things ? [patient] yeah . [doctor] okay . [patient] this finger i hurt it sometime ago as well . [doctor] really ? [patient] yeah , it does n't work properly or it works very rarely . [doctor] gotcha and did i hear that she gave you some prednisone and some oral steroids or ? [patient] well she gave me some numbing medicine , it helped a little bit . the other two were a neck pill and gabapentin , [doctor] you should have a full list in your notes though since then it has n't really bothered me at night also just see now i am a va and him 1 % disabled from this leg issues from the knees down to my feet okay is it neuropathy gotcha , that is good to know . alright , well , let's go ahead and take a look . [patient] okay . [doctor] alright , so to start , i'm gon na have you do something for me just go ahead and tilt your chin as far as you can down to your chest . okay , good and now go the other way , tilting your chin up as far as you can . now , does that seem to bother you at all ? okay and now come back to normal , just look and turn your head as far as you can that way great and now as far as you can towards that wall , does not seem to bother you at all now well actually i do feel little strain okay so you feel it in the neck a little bit yet is a little strain okay now squeeze my fingers as hard as you can with both hands great now hold your arms like this . [patient] okay . [doctor] and i'm going to try to straighten your arms and try and keep them as stiff as you can , do n't let me straighten it . okay , good , good . now when i am just touching your hands like this , does it seem to feel about the same in both hands ? [patient] yes . [doctor] okay . alright so i do agree with betty more than likely this seems like it would be coming from your neck that's the most common reason that causes what what you're experiencing . and i looked at an x-ray of your neck and you do seem to have a lot of arthritis there and there does seem to be potential for a disc to be pushing on a nerve . and now what i do n't have is an mri which would show me kind of exactly where the nerve roots are getting pinched off . [patient] i see . [doctor] so gabapentin can help a little bit with the nerve pain and what i would like to do is potentially set you up for an epidural and what that is is it it's a focused anti-inflammatory medicine excuse me , that works behind the nerve roots , that nerve roots that we are thinking might be getting squished off . it can often help alleviate your symptoms and i do need to get an mri of your neck . i know we have had one of your lower back , but i need one of your neck to see exactly where the roots are getting pinched off . so what i can do is tentatively set you up for an epidural , but before you do that , we do need to get that mri so i can see . right where i need to put the medicine for your epidural . what do you think of that ? [patient] i think that sounds good to me . [doctor] okay , good and just to confirm , do you take any blood thinners ? i do n't think i saw any on your medicine list . [patient] no , i do n't . [doctor] okay good and what i would have you do is continue with the gabapentin are you taking 300 or 100 ? [patient] i'm not sure my lady friend helps me handle this stuff . [doctor] okay . [patient] i am taking eliquis though . [doctor] okay so whatever you are doing , you can just keep doing it and i'm going to set you up for the epidural and imaging study just so i know right up with the medicine and i will follow up with you after that and we can do the shot just to make sure your arm is feeling better sound good . [patient] sounds good . for the last couple of nights though my neck has not been bothering me . [doctor] okay so presumably what's happening then is when you're sleeping , your neck is kinda gets off tilt tilter and it compresses the nerve roots there . now if you think you're doing fine , we could hold off , but at the very least , i'd like to update that mri of yours and see what's going on because probably this is something that will likely flare up again . [patient] yeah it it has been for the last week , so i understand . okay , alright , well , do you want to do that work-up and do the epidural or do you think you're doing fine and do you wan na wait ? well my hand is still bothering me . okay . so you're saying your neck is not bothering you , but the hand is . okay , so then let's just stick with the plan . [doctor] mri of the neck , so we can see where the nerve roots maybe compressed that's giving your hand the issue and then we are going to set you up with the epidural . [patient] okay , sounds good . [doctor] alright , so keep going with the gabapentin . i will order the imaging of your neck and the shot will hopefully help some with those symptoms in your hand and then we will follow up afterwards . [patient] alright , is the mri today ? [doctor] you probably ca n't do it today , but let me talk with roy and see how soon we can get it done . just give me a quick minute and then roy will come in and get things scheduled as soon as we can . alright . [patient] alright , well , it was nice meeting you my friend .

[patient] his notable things are # 1 , he is on 1 ml every 10 days . his levels were less than 300 to begin with . he is on finasteride currently . he also takes cialis daily , so he takes all his pills just from me , patient's other area of concern is gynecomastia , which is , which we will discuss with him today . his last psa was 0.66 and his last testosterone was greater than 1500 . [doctor] hey , how are you today ? [patient] alright , how you been ? [doctor] i'm good . [patient] good , good . [doctor] have you lost some weight or you at least putting on some muscle , you look trump . [patient] no , i think i'm pretty much the same as i've always been . [doctor] really ? okay , maybe it's just your black shirt , makes you look then . [patient] yeah , i guess that's it . [doctor] so health wise , how is everything going ? [patient] good , the testosterone is going well . [doctor] that's great . [patient] helped me out , i feel good , more vigorous , sleeping well and i think it's having some positive effects , not so much physically because like i said , i've i've been this way my whole life , but i'm seeing some good improvements in my blood work . [doctor] okay , well , that's good . [patient] so the finasteride i am only taking half a pill , it's the 5 mg one . [doctor] yeah , i remember you telling me that . [patient] and cialis on the days i work out , i take 5 mg , otherwise i take 2-1/2 mg pills , but i have been out of it . [doctor] okay . [patient] but overall i'm doing well . i'm actually taking the correct steps to get my life together . [doctor] good . it's always great to hear . let's look i'm gon na listen to your heart and lungs . [patient] okay . [doctor] please use my general exam template alright just take a few breaths . [patient] okay . [doctor] now . alright everything sounds good , no concerns there . [patient] great . so i wanted to show you something . [doctor] sure . [patient] look at this . [doctor] okay , this is your cholesterol . [patient] yeah , my cholesterol and triglycerides , i used to have high triglycerides , you see they were 265 mg/dl , then i took my first dose of the testosterone on the 28th . [doctor] right . [patient] now 5 months later look at my numbers . [doctor] wow , that's remarkable . [patient] this is the test , it's the only change . i do n't know , i have n't honestly seen many guys over the years that have cholesterol problems and this i mean there is a big correlation between diabetic control and testosterone replacement meaning those who get good levels of their tests see their diabetic control improve . [doctor] yeah . but i have n't seen a lot of data on the impact on cholesterol . regardless we will take it . [patient] i agree . i was very impressed with my triglycerides and was just wondering if the test may be what's helping . [doctor] yeah , that's an unbelievable difference . [patient] 145 mg/dl from 265 mg/dl is awesome . i also read that it it's cardioprotective . [doctor] absolutely . [patient] my red blood cell count has increased . [doctor] yeah , i saw that . it's fine though . [patient] stable . [doctor] your psa a today is also is good also . it's 0.6 i think . [patient] yeah is it ? [doctor] yeah , it was 0.5 last year and anything under four is good . [patient] nice , such good news . [doctor] so it just needs to be checked every year or so . [patient] so in terms of estrogen control , i've been hearing that indol three carbonal or broccoli extract , supposedly can improve my estrogen levels . have you ever heard of it ? yeah , i've heard of it , but i have n't had anybody consistently use it . i mean your levels are fine and we checked your estradiol and it was not elevated , so . okay . [doctor] i would argue that we could test that in the fall if you want , but we do n't need to do anymore tests anymore than test once a year , excuse me . [patient] okay . what about increasing my testosterone to 175 mg . i'm at 140 now . [doctor] well , your levels are high . [patient] are they right now ? [doctor] well , i mean they were last time . [patient] yeah , but i just just injected though where i had right before that was taken . [doctor] i know , i know you had then . when did you inject this time ? [patient] i figured i'm on my eighth day today . [doctor] okay . [patient] so i'm due to dose on thursday or friday . [doctor] alright . [patient] i have a little med calendar and i put checks and teas on it , that helps me . [doctor] that's a great idea . so look the biggest issue i've seen even if your levels today are around 700 is that your peaks are getting greater than 1500 , putting you at a higher chance of needing to come off due to blood thickness and your risk will only go up the higher the dose that we go on . [patient] okay . [doctor] you look well , your levels are good and you are feeling well . [patient] yeah , i'm feeling good . [doctor] i'm going to be blunt . unfortunately this happens often where you are feeling good but you want to feel really good . i mean i get it , and this is why people get into problems with this stuff , right ? it's like back in the day when it was n't prescribed by doctors and people would get it at gyms and stuff and they would take huge doses and then they would have a heart attack at 50 . [patient] yeah , they have to be taking a lot . [doctor] likely they are taking more than testosterone but still . [patient] and they are taking stuff for a long time . [doctor] true but right now i would not change your dose . [patient] okay . [doctor] makes sense ? [patient] it does , i appreciate the discussion . [doctor] no problem . what pharmacy are you using ? have you changed it or anything ? [patient] no changes , i use walmart pharmacy . i do need more cialis and finasteride . [doctor] okay . [patient] i would prefer the paper prescription . [doctor] for all of them ? [patient] sure . [doctor] alright , we will do . let me go get your prescriptions .

[patient] yeah i'm able to afford afford them i have good insurance i am taking them they told me it's really important to take them so so yeah
[doctor] yeah that's very accurate you know like there are huge consequences to not taking them so if you are noticing any problems please please please please let us know how about your diet are you watching your salt intake
[patient] i mean i'm not i i i have n't really adjusted i mean i tried to watch it after the last heart attack and now you know i i've kind of been less strict with my diet but i'll have to go back to watching the salt intake
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] i love pizza it's my favorite food
[doctor] yeah
[patient] my tries are probably my second favorite food
[doctor] what are you for her toppings on pizza
[patient] pepperoni occasionally vegetables
[doctor] mm-hmm alright but you know that pepperoni is pretty high in salt on top of a cheesy pizza right
[patient] i know i know i'm gon na work on it
[doctor] okay so we are we are gon na have to negotiate some of these diet things and then especially since you have diabetes like have you been managing that well
[patient] my i've been watching my sugars yep because i do n't wan na go on insulin so i'm taking that metformin that's why i've been walking my dog i'm trying to stay active
[doctor] okay okay so you know maybe this is just a situation of like where we are on the right path but probably need to step up a few things okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so i do want to do a quick physical exam so you are aware i'm going to be calling out my findings as i run through it alright
[patient] okay
[doctor] alright so your vital signs look good you know so i'm glad that it looks like you're tolerating your medication pretty well on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention so and then on top of that i'm not i do n't appreciate any carotid bruits so i'm not feeling anything like too concerning on your heart exam though there is a three over six systolic ejection murmur heard at the that i'm hearing at the left base that's not like a huge deal especially considering like what you've been through already in terms of the hospital but it is something that i wan na know in your chart when i listen to you your lungs your lungs are clear over here with your extremities i do notice you know some lower lower edema swelling sorry some lower swelling edema lower limb edema and it it is pitting one plus on your right radial artery the cath site is clean dry and intact without hematoma and i also your right radial artery pulses are palpable so i did review the results of your ekg and they show a normal sinus rhythm and a good r wave progression and a a evolutionary changes that are anticipated after a stemi one of the reasons though that we had you come in is that we noticed on your echo there is a reduced ejection fraction of thirty five percent we are a little bit concerned about that so let's talk about my assessment and plan for you your primary and like first diagnosis is gon na be coronary artery disease right you already have a history of that but you know we're gon na do some things to make we're gon na continue to evaluate that over time i want you to continue your aspirin eighty one milligrams daily and your brilinta ninety milligrams twice daily i wan na continue you on a high dose statin called lipitor and you're gon na be taking that eighty milligrams a day and we're gon na continue you on your toprol and that's gon na be fifty milligrams daily i am gon na refer you to cardiac rehab so we can get you some education and give you some confidence to get back to exercising regularly i know it was kinda scary to have such an episode but i promise like most of the patients i have love cardiac rehab and i think you'll do pretty well for your second diagnosis we have newly you have newly reduced left ventricular dysfunction and moderate mitral regurgitation what i think is like what that means is that you're you're pumping like the way that your heart is pumping is a bit concerning but i think like given your history that it will improve over time they got you into the cath lab pretty quickly so i think that the muscle is just kinda like stunned like surprised and since you're compliant with your meds i think you will recover we are gon na continue you on your lisinopril twenty milligrams daily however considering that you are retaining fluid i think that your third diagnosis is like we are crossing into acute heart failure i'm gon na prescribe something called a diuretic it's called lasix and i do want to we need to take that forty milligrams once a day i wan na add aldactone twelve . five milligrams daily and i need you to get labs finally we will repeat another echo in about two months last but not least there is the hypertension your blood pressure seems fine i think with the aldactone that you'll tolerate that pretty well but we do want to maybe get you into some nutrition counseling to consider like what other diet options might be available to you maybe suggestions of things that you have n't thought about like cutting out meat especially any kind of preserved meat like pepperoni but maybe finding you some alternatives how does that sound
[patient] that sounds good yeah so i'm yeah as long as you tell me i'm gon na get better i believe you
[doctor] yes yeah i i strongly believe this is our best course of action and that you will get better given enough time i i see that you are making efforts i'm really glad that you are out there walking and that you're cognizant of your diet and willing to make changes we will just you know monitor it over time okay

aci_nan_ACI029,"[doctor] alright scott so so i understand that you you had some right knee injury can you tell me a little bit about what happened
[patient] yeah i was trying to go out and play some pickup soccer games over the weekend and went to go plank kick the ball and and just felt a pop in my right knee
[doctor] okay and and how long ago did that happen
[patient] about three days ago
[doctor] three days okay and when did you notice any swelling anything like that
[patient] it it's swollen some some of that swelling has gone down
[doctor] okay
[patient] but it it mainly just it it feels like that i just i ca n't my knee is just not as functionally it's not moving as well as what it used to be it seems to be a little limited
[doctor] okay alright and then so how's the pain with your knee on a scale of one to ten one being the least pain ten being the worst pain how's how's it been ranging
[patient] it's somewhere between six and seven right now it's about four or five with some of the swelling going down
[doctor] okay alright and did you take anything at all to relieve the pain
[patient] anti-inflammatories
[doctor] okay alrighty and did that help
[patient] yeah the ibuprofen helped a little bit but i'm on it pretty on a pretty regular basis right now
[doctor] gotcha okay now tell me are you able to bend or straighten your leg ever since then
[patient] i can bend it but it hurts towards the end of the motion and i can straighten it but it does n't it feels like i have to help get it straightened
[doctor] okay alright and then how about you able to bear any weight on it or walk on it at all
[patient] i can still bear weight on it but it feels just really loose it it does n't feel normal
[doctor] gotcha okay alright well let's go ahead and take a look at your knee here real quick before i take a look at your knee here i'm gon na do a physical exam and in terms of your gait here i did notice that you do have a marked limp on your looks like it's your right leg upon ambulation so let me go ahead and take a look at that right knee real quick i do appreciate some significant effusion in the right knee just a slight bit of ecchymosis let me just feel around here scott how does that feel does that hurt when i kinda press on that there
[patient] a little bit of pain there not not really bad it's it feels like it's just more on the inside of my knee
[doctor] yep okay so you definitely feeling some a little bit of pain to palpation at the medial joint line now i'm gon na have you lie on your back and also i'm gon na do some maneuvering here of your leg i'm gon na do a real quick test on you here okay alright how does that feel
[patient] just feels just feels loose it hurts when you pull it at the very end
[doctor] okay sorry about that alright so you're definitely having some difficulty with some passive range of motion here and you're lacking a few degrees of terminal extension to about a hundred and fifteen degrees as well as lacking about maybe twenty to thirty degrees of terminal flexion on the secondary secondary to the pain here and you do have a positive lachman exam so one more thing i wan na take a look at real quick i'm gon na take a look at your toes here real quick very good so neurovascularly your bilateral lower extremities are intact and it looks like you have a muscle strength of a five out of five so scott you know based on my examination here your right knee injury is really suggestive of anterior cruciate ligament tear and you've heard of it probably even heard as acl tear sometimes especially when a lot of people do sports and they injure their knee that that can happen so my plan for you though is i wan na i wan na go ahead and order an mri because i wan na evaluate the integrity of that acl now you may need surgery but we'll we'll first take a look at that mri result and reevaluate and reevaluate that first but in the meantime i wan na go ahead and order some anti-inflammatory medication meloxicam 15 milligrams a day it's gon na help reduce that swelling and the pain and then i want you to go ahead and ice the knee if you need to if you're still seeing some swelling and some pain you can go ahead and use ice as well but i definitely would like for you to moderate your activities so i would like for you to wear a knee immobilizer and then also use crutches when you walk around just to help you a little bit so not to put too much stress and strain on that knee does that sound like a plan
[patient] it it does now well i need to limit my work activities i i typically sit behind a desk but it's not been very comfortable sitting here lately
[doctor] yeah definitely so yeah so you you can limit the activities for sure in terms of your work activities i know if you sit too long sometimes it can be painful because you do need to move that leg a little bit so it does n't lock up so i i would like for you to you know do do some slight activities not enough to stress your legs but definitely move move them a little bit every now and then so it does n't lock up on you okay

aci_nan_ACI034,"[doctor] hey jose how are you doing it's been about you know three or four months since i last saw you what's going on
[patient] i'm doing okay i i guess the medications are helping i'm concerned about all the medications i'm taking but i think i'm doing okay
[doctor] yeah yeah you are on a fair amount of medications you know we do have you on those medications because you did have a heart attack about six months ago they put that that stent into your left anterior descending artery and so that's a major artery on the left side of your heart and so we need to keep those stents open and and kinda help your heart heal so it is gon na be very important for you to continue on those medications so you're still taking your aspirin and are you still taking the brilinta
[patient] yes and and fish oil
[doctor] and fish oil okay good now how are you doing with the crestor i know that that's you know that's the statin that's the cholesterol medication you were concerned that it might cause you to have some muscle aches are you taking that
[patient] i i think i'm doing good but i i am i feel like i i when i i guess the only complaint that i have is ever since i i do n't know if this is the heart attack or if this this is the the medication but when i stand up real fast i get really dizzy
[doctor] you get you get dizzy okay yeah you know we do have you on a what we call a beta-blocker metoprolol i think your dose is fifty milligrams once a day and you know sometimes it takes a little bit for your body to adjust to that but yes if you stand up too quickly it can cause you to be a little dizzy so
[patient] okay okay that makes sense okay that's good to know because i did n't know what what what the problem was so can i ask you a question regarding the stents
[doctor] yep
[patient] how long do i have to have that in there
[doctor] so the stents are permanent we do n't we do n't remove them so yep so that's why it's gon na be super important for you you know you're gon na be on aspirin for the rest of your life and then i'm gon na keep you on that brilinta for another six months that's gon na help prevent the that stent from clogging
[patient] okay okay do i need to ever replace the stents then
[doctor] no i mean every so often the stents can become narrowed again but you know that's why you're seeing me your cardiologist so that i can follow you for that now if you start to have symptoms again of any chest pain like you had before or any shortness of breath when you start to exert yourself i want you to tell me and we might have to go ahead and send you for further testing to make sure that those stents are okay but typically if you continue to take the medication watch your diet that type of thing your stents will will stay open for a long time
[patient] okay alright that sounds good you know i have n't i had a i had i know you asked me to follow up with the dietitian because i had diabetes as well which probably contributed to my heart attack
[doctor] yeah
[patient] i may need a new order i do n't i i forgot who i was supposed to talk to
[doctor] okay that's okay yeah i certainly can help you with that now managing your diabetes is also going to play an important role in your coronary artery disease which it sounds like you already know that which is really good so i will put in another referral for diabetic education for you how are you doing watching your sweets i know that you know you do have an afinity for those chocolate chip cookies
[patient] it's okay my a1c was n't where i wanted but my glucose is coming in in about one thirty
[doctor] okay
[patient] fasting
[doctor] okay what was the what was the a1c the hemoglobin a1c if you do n't mind me asking
[patient] i thought it was close to sixteen
[doctor] okay yeah that's really high so we want it to be about six so you you do have some work to do with your diet
[patient] yeah yeah so okay so i know you asked me to do a blood test so i did that i was wondering if you got the results
[doctor] i did you know i looked at the results of your kidney function that's what we call your creatinine just because you had some contrast dye and sometimes contrast dye can impact the kidneys and your kidney function is stable which is great when was the last time you saw your nephrologist
[patient] oh
[doctor] that's your kidney doctor
[patient] i'm a bad i'm a bad patient so probably a year ago
[doctor] okay you know you do have the stage three ckd so that's the the stage three kidney disease so it is gon na be important for you to follow up with your nephrologist just to make sure that everything is okay now i did check your kidney function and and it was fine but are you staying away from things like motrin and advil
[patient] right yeah that's i threw all of those out
[doctor] okay good okay perfect now i know that you're from the west coast are you super excited that la one the super bowl or are you more of a san francisco forty nine or span
[patient] i'm a more of a san francisco fan
[doctor] so do you like jimmy g do you think he can beat erin rogers again
[patient] okay we'll see we'll see what happens but i'm pretty flexible when he comes to you know that is but one thing that since i ca n't take motrin what pain killer can i take for headaches
[doctor] you can take tylenol
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah
[patient] alright that sounds good
[doctor] yeah
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay
[patient] this is i i do n't think i have any other question the only thing i'm gon na need is a i need some refills on my medications
[doctor] yeah i can do that but i do wan na just do a physical exam on you okay so and looking here at your vital signs here you know your your vital signs look quite good you know your blood pressure is what right where it should be it's about one twenty seven over eighty which is great so you're doing a good job taking your metoprolol now in terms of on your neck exam i do n't appreciate any jugular venous distention or carotid bruits on your heart exam i do appreciate a slight three out of six systolic ejection murmur heard at the left base and on your lower extremity exam i do appreciate some one plus nonpitting edema now what does that mean what does that mean jose so all of that means is that i do hear a little heart murmur on your heart which i've heard before in the past and it does n't it does n't look like you're retaining any fluid which is good but you do have a little puffiness in your legs which sometimes some of the medications can cause
[patient] yeah i do have that
[doctor] so let's just go over a little bit about my assessment and and plan for you going forward so for your first problem of your coronary artery disease i think you're doing really well i wan na go ahead and refer you for cardiac rehab just so that you can be more active and have some confidence in in exercising again okay and i am gon na go ahead and refill your metoprolol your crestor forty milligrams once a day as well as the aspirin okay i do n't think we need to proceed with a a stress test or anything at this time but you know to let me know if you have any symptoms okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] okay for your
[patient] sounds really good
[doctor] good for your second problem of your stage three chronic kidney disease i am gon na reach out to doctor miller and make an appointment for you to be seen just because again i think it's important for you to follow up with your nephrologist okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] and then for your third problem of your diabetes i am gon na go ahead and order another hemoglobin a1c and i'm gon na put that referral in for the dietitian to give you some dietary education and i'm gon na go ahead and talk with your primary care physician about your your insulin regimen okay
[patient] okay
[doctor] any questions
[patient] yeah you know i've been kinda down ever since i had my heart attack is there any medication that i could take to make me feel a little bit less sad
[doctor] yeah i mean are you having any thoughts of of harming yourself or harming others
[patient] no no i just feel kinda down
[doctor] you feel kinda down what's your
[patient] life sucks
[doctor] what well i do n't think so what what's your support system like
[patient] you know i i live with my dog and that's it so it's kind of you know lonely
[doctor] okay alright well would you be interested in in like a referral to psychiatry or something like that so that you have someone to talk to about some of of issues because medication can help but i do i think it's important to have you know talk some of these things out
[patient] okay yeah you know i'll give that a try i mean i'm retiring i got plenty of time
[doctor] okay so why do n't we go ahead and i'm gon na place a referral to psychiatry for you know you know difficulty adjusting after having a heart attack maybe some some mild depression okay does that sound okay okay
[patient] yeah that sounds really good thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome anything else
[patient] so you will do the medication refill do i so that's automatic
[doctor] yep i'm gon na put them into the computer and and whatever pharmacy you want yep mm-hmm
[patient] okay alright sounds great thank you
[doctor] okay you're welcome i'll be in touch bye

aci_nan_ACI079,"[doctor] good afternoon alexis i understand you're having some issues with your hand
[patient] yes i sit at the keyboard all day long and recently i've been having some numbness and tingling in my right hand
[doctor] okay how long has that been going on
[patient] i do n't know probably on and off for six months but over the last month or so it's been a little more persistent
[doctor] okay okay and when does that numbness and tingling do you get a lot of pain with it first let me ask that question
[patient] some pain
[doctor] some pain
[patient] mostly when i'm actually typing on the keyboard is when i experience the pain
[doctor] okay
[patient] but the numbness and tingling is all the time now
[doctor] okay and when you get this pain what makes it better is it stopping and just resting for a while or do you take medications or try other
[patient] i've been taking ibuprofen so ibuprofen and seem like not typing on the keyboard helps the most
[doctor] okay
[patient] the other thing that makes it hurt is my mouse
[doctor] your okay
[patient] wow
[doctor] yeah when you're moving that around okay
[patient] yeah
[doctor] does this pain ever wake you up in the middle of the night or the pain or the tingling
[patient] no
[doctor] no okay
[patient] not affecting my sleep hmmm
[doctor] okay so and you're using motrin for for ibuprofen for for the pain well let me go ahead and take a take a look here at your is it both hands or just your right hand
[patient] mostly my right hand
[doctor] mostly your right hand okay so let's go ahead and take a look at that right hand when i bend your wrist does that cause any pain
[patient] yes
[doctor] it does okay and so you do have some pain on extension and if you pull your your hand wrist up towards you does that cause the pain also
[patient] yes
[doctor] yeah okay so you do have pain on flexion and extension and when i touch the fingertips here now you said you had some numbness in your thumb and your index finger and a little bit in your your middle finger the other two fingers they feel okay or do you think that there is different than the other hand
[patient] yeah for some reason it really is just that the thumb the pointer in the middle finger that i experience the most symptoms with
[doctor] okay
[patient] not why that is
[doctor] okay so i i want you to grip my hands here and just squeeze tight okay so you do have a a little bit of a less grip strength on the right and that's typical that we would see with this type of pain and and numbness that you have going on now i want you to turn your arm over for me and i'm gon na touch on or tap on the inside of your wrist or or forearm and when i do that i can see your face you're grimacing so that that that must cause that shooting pain yeah okay so you do have a positive tinel's sign so in alexis what i think is going on is that you have a a carpal tunnel syndrome and we see that frequent
[patient] i was afraid of
[doctor] yeah you see this frequently but people who are doing data entry spend a lot of time on keyboards or you know some a lotta manufacturing people who do a repetitive procedure again and again will get that type of pain so here is my plan i'd like to put you in a splint and it's it's it's kind of a wrist splint i would like you to wear that at night that will help with that i want you to continue with the ibuprofens but i would like you to go up to six hundred milligrams four times a day and
[patient] okay
[doctor] we're gon na do that now i am going to order some a a outpatient test called an emg where we look at that nerve conduction study in that wrist and that's really what's happening here is you've got some thickening in the the in the wrist and the the the membranes of the wrist that are just pressing down and just compressing some of those nerves any other questions for me for now if that test comes back positive and we'll talk about that later on your next visit if it comes back positive we may have to do we're gon na stick with conservative treatment first but we may consider some surgery where i can go in and release that impingement on your nerves through your wrist it's a simple outpatient procedure and then i think you would feel better how does that sound
[patient] that sounds like a good plan i was hoping maybe i could get some relief with some therapy rather than having to go to surgery so i like that plan very much
[doctor] yeah we'll start with the the wrist splint and once i get the nerve conduction studies that will give me another idea whether or not i need to send you some physical therapy in addition or if we need to go directly to surgery but that will all hinge on that nerve conduction test do you so do you have any further questions
[patient] no that's great thank you so much

aci_nan_ACI001,"[doctor] hey george how are you today i understand you're here for some numbness and tingling in your fingers and some pain in your wrist
[patient] right my left wrist and hand has been bothering me probably for a few months now with pain and numbness
[doctor] okay and you said that's been ongoing for several months do you know what caused this type of pain or is it just something that started slowly or
[patient] it just kinda started on it's own it i notice it mostly at night
[doctor] okay
[patient] sometimes it will i'll wake up and my hands asleep and i got ta shake it out
[doctor] shake it out and okay
[patient] and then some
[doctor] what kind of work do you do
[patient] i do yard work
[doctor] yard work
[patient] landscaping landscaping
[doctor] landscaping okay so a lot of raking a lot of digging so a lot of repetitive type movements
[patient] yeah it's pretty heavy labor but it's yeah the same thing day in and day out
[doctor] okay okay just a couple questions for you you did say that you have the pain at night in that and you have to you get that numbness into the hand is it in all the fingers
[patient] yeah it seems to happen to all my fingers but i notice it more in my thumb and pointer finger
[doctor] okay okay and anything into that little into your fifth finger your little finger any numbness there at times no
[patient] sometimes yeah it seems like it's numb too
[doctor] okay what about your right hand any problems with that hand
[patient] no i do n't seem to have any problems with my right hand so far it's just mostly my left
[doctor] okay okay good and just a couple you know do you how do you have many or do you drink often do you have you know many any alcohol consumption
[patient] i drink usually a a beer or two on fridays and saturdays on the weekends
[doctor] okay and do you have any evidence of any anybody ever said that you had some rheumatoid arthritis in your hand or wrist anything like that
[patient] no nobody say anything like that so i mean
[doctor] okay okay good so let me go ahead and do a physical exam here real quick and you know i'm gon na quickly just listen to your heart and lungs okay that's good i'd like you to squeeze i'm gon na hold your hands here and i'd like you to squeeze both hands
[patient] okay
[doctor] you seem a little bit weaker on that left hand is that what you've noticed
[patient] yeah i i i experienced some weakness in my left hand
[doctor] okay do you you find that you're dropping things when you're picking it up is it to that level or
[patient] yeah i drop things mostly because i have a hard time feeling it
[doctor] okay okay good and so you you do have a a grip strength is less on the left and i just wan na touch your fingers here on the on the right side you can feel me touching all the fingers on the right
[patient] yeah i can i can say you touch me but it feels a little more weird on the thumb side than my pointer finger side
[doctor] okay okay and i wan na turn your wrist over here and turn your hand over and i'm gon na go ahead and tap on the right wrist on the back here does that do anything when i do that
[patient] i still i feel a little jolt or a zing in my finger tips
[doctor] okay and then when i do that on the left side
[patient] yeah same thing
[doctor] same thing okay so you do have a bilateral positive tinel's sign so so here's here's where i'm at i think your your diagnosis is beginning to have some bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome usually we see that with repetitive actions such as the landscaping the heavy labor and you you know your your clinical exam and and history sound like it's a carpal tunnel syndrome i do want to order so where are we gon na go from here i would like to order a a study it's called an emg where it it measures some of that electrical impulses down into your fingers we will follow up with that but as far as your treatment so the treatment for carpal tunnel syndrome is really some activity modification now i know you are a landscaper is there any way that you could be work to have some lighter work during the time
[patient] i suppose i could try to pass it off to some of my other employes and delegate
[doctor] okay that would be good so that's i i just want you to kinda eliminate that the active repetitive motions that you're doing all the time just for a couple weeks i'm also gon na give you a wrist splint to wear and that should help and i'd like you to take ibuprofen six hundred milligrams every six hours and then i wan na see you back here in the office in two weeks and in that two week period i think we're gon na see if there's need for any other intervention if i need to do more diagnostic testing or if there is a possibly looking at a surgical intervention to release that pressure that's on the nerves in that hand does that sound like a a good plan for you
[patient] yeah it sounds like a good first start
[doctor] okay okay so i i just just off off the record here what kind of what do what do you specialize in landscaping is your company do
[patient] mostly like yard work and maintenance flower beds not really designing just up keep
[doctor] okay yeah i'm looking for a landscape designer i need somebody to put in some elaborate walkways back through the backyard so yeah we can do stuff like that i mean if you have an idea what you want i think that's easy
[patient] okay
[doctor] you know if you're looking for like some
[patient] backyard elasis rehab remodel that's i mean i suppose we could do we have n't done things like that in a while because we're busy enough with just the up key but it's something to explore
[doctor] okay yeah i may have to keep that in mind because i do wan na do some of that so let's listen i'm gon na get my my nurse in here to discharge you do you have any other questions for me before we end this
[patient] no i think it's all clear i appreciate it

aci_nan_ACI020,"[doctor] hey mason good to see you today so let's see you here in my notes for evaluation of kidney stones your your pcp said you had some kidney stones so you got a referral over so can you tell me a little bit about that you know what happened when did you first notice them
[patient] yeah it was about you know about a week ago and i was working down in the the barn with the horses and you know i was moving some hay but i developed this real sudden onset of pain in my right back and i thought it initially it was from throwing hay but it i broke out into a sweat i got real nauseated and that's when i went and saw my doctor and he ordered a cat scan and said that i had a kidney stone but you know that's i i've never had that before my father's had them in the past but yeah so that's that's how that all happened
[doctor] okay so you said you had the pain on the right hand side does it move anywhere or radiate
[patient] well when i had it it would it radiated almost down to my groin
[doctor] okay
[patient] not the whole way down but almost to the groin and since then i have n't had any more pain and it's just been right about there
[doctor] okay and is the pain constant or does it come and go
[patient] well when i you know after i found out i had a disk a kidney stone it came a couple times but it did n't last as long no i've been i've been straining my urine they told me to pee in this little cup
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and i've been straining my urine and you know i do n't see anything in there
[doctor] okay have you noticed any blood in your urine i know you've been draining probably take a good look at it has it been darker than usual
[patient] no not really not really darker

[patient] i've never had a kidney stone my dad had them a lot but i've never had one
[doctor] okay alright so let me do a quick exam of you your vital signs look good i do n't see any fever or your blood pressure and heart rate are fine so let me do a quick physical exam let me press here on your belly so on your examination of your abdomen there is no tenderness to to pain to palpation of the abdomen there is no rebound or guarding there is cva there is tenderness on the right side so that means
[patient] i have a stroke
[doctor] can you repeat that
[patient] i did i have a stroke
[doctor] no no no no no so that means like everything is normal right but i feel like you you you have some tenderness and inflammation over your kidney so that has to be expected because you do have a kidney stone so i did review the results of your ct and it does show a stone that's measuring point five centimeters located in the proximal right ureter and that's that duct that classes from your your kidney to down to your bladder there is no evidence of hydronephrosis that would mean that the stone is obstruct obstructing the ureter causing swelling in the kidney so there is there is no evidence of that so let's talk a little bit about my assessment and plan so you do have that kidney stone so right now i'm gon na recommend that we we have you push fluids just to help facilitate you urinating and passing the stone i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams every six to eight hours for pain and you can continue to take tylenol between that for any breakthrough pain and you already have a strainer so that's good continue to use that and we can see continue that until the stone passes and i'm also gon na order a bmp and your urinalysis and urine culture just to make sure that everything else is okay with you and based on urinalysis we can see if we need to prescribe you antibiotics see if you have any type of infection i do want to see you back in about one to two weeks and hopefully by that time you you passed the stone but if not we can discuss further treatment lithotripsy it's like a shock wave kinda breaks up that stone it's not it's not that invasive procedure but we can just we can discuss that if it has n't passed in that one to two weeks that sound good

[patient] an ace wrap
[doctor] and an ace wrap okay now how many days ago was this exactly

[patient] correct
[doctor] and do you check your blood sugars every morning at home
[patient] every morning
[doctor] okay great and since this i'm the reason i'm asking all these questions i'm a little concerned about the inactivity with your your knee pain and you know how diabetes you need to be very you know active and and taking your medicine to keep that under control so you know may wan na continue to follow up with your pcp for that diabetes as we go through here and just watch your blood sugars extra as we go through that now i'm gon na go ahead and examine your your right knee and when i push on the outside does that hurt at all

[patient] some exercises ice and motrin
[doctor] okay okay so i'm gon na continue all of my exam when i go ahead and pull on your knee the first thing i'm looking at is i do see some ecchymosis and swelling on the inside of that right knee and when i push around that knee i can see that there is fluid in the knee a little bit of fluid in the knee we call that effusion so i can appreciate some of that effusion and that could be either fluid or blood at this point from the injury that you had now you do have pain with palpation on the medial aspect of that right knee and that's that's concerning for me when i'm gon na just i just wan na move your knee a little bit it does n't look like when i extend it and flex it that you have a full range of motion does it hurt a lot when i moved it back a little more than normal
[patient] yes it hurts
[doctor] okay okay yeah so you do have some decreased range of motion in that right knee now i'm just gon na sit here and and lay you back and i'm gon na pull on your knee and twist your knee a little bit okay you currently there is a negative varus and valgus stress test that's really important so here's what i'm thinking for that right knee i think you have may have a medial collateral ligament strain from you know maybe the twisting motion be right before you fell to the ground i want you to continue to use an ace wrap i'm gon na give you a right knee brace we're gon na wear that for a few days and then i'm gon na send you to physical therapy so we can continue strengthening the muscles around the right knee now that x-ray as far as the x-ray results that x-ray that i did it this morning in the office the the bony alignment's in good position i do n't see any evidence of any fractures i do notice the the effusion around the right knee just a small amount of fluid but we're just gon na continue to watch that i'm gon na give you a prescription i'd like you to stop taking any of the nonsteroidals that you're taking the motrin or advil whichever one of those and i'm gon na give you meloxicam fifteen milligrams and i want you to take that daily for the pain and swelling i want you to just continue exercising with the the braces and everything on so if you can you can get out and do some light walking that'll be good and then again for your diabetes like i said just continue to watch those blood sugars daily and if you start to see any significant increase in them because of your loss of activity just reach out to your primary care physician now do you have any questions for me
[patient] when can i play basketball again
[doctor] yeah that's a great question i'm gon na ask well my first off i want to see you back here in in seven days you know in a week i want you to make an appointment we're gon na relook at it we're gon na determine if that swelling got any worse and if we need to go on to potentially ordering like a cat scan or an mri of that knee to look and see if there was any significant damage to the ligament so that's for for sure for seven days you're not gon na be playing basketball now are you in a ligue or is that just you get like pick up basketball
[patient] i just pay at the y for fun
[doctor] okay okay good that's a great activity like i said i wish i could play now i i also know your your family do n't they own that sports store down right off a main street that sells a lot of sporting equipment

aci_nan_ACI048,"[doctor] hey linda good to see you today so looking here in my notes looks like you you think you have a kidney stone think you've had them before and and you i guess you're having some pain and while we are here i see you i see you have a you have past medical history of hypertension diabetes and we will check up on those as well so with your kidney stone can you tell me what happened what's going on
[patient] and i've been in a lot of pain it started about i would say probably about three days ago
[doctor] okay
[patient] started having pain on my left back
[doctor] okay
[patient] and since then i continued to have pain it is traveling a little lower it's gotten little low but i definitely have not passed it yet and i'm just in so much pain
[doctor] okay so is the pain that you're having is it constant or does it come and go
[patient] it's constant
[doctor] okay
[patient] all the time i ca n't get comfortable
[doctor] alright are you able to urinate
[patient] i am and this morning i actually started seeing some blood
[doctor] okay yeah so and i know you said i see you've had some kidney stones in the past like how many times would you say you've had one of these episodes
[patient] i've had it for probably this might be my third time
[doctor] third time alright
[patient] yeah i have n't had one in a while but yeah this is my third time
[doctor] okay so have you noticed any nausea chills fever
[patient] no fever some chills and i i just in so much pain i i ca n't eat and i do feel a little nauseous
[doctor] okay that sound definitely understandable so you've been in a lot of pain so have you tried to take any medications to alleviate the pain
[patient] yeah i've been taking tylenol i have had to try some ibuprofen i know you said to be careful with my blood pressure but i have been trying to do that because i'm just in so much pain and it's not really working
[doctor] okay and before what would you how long would you say it took you to pass the other stones or how was that that resolved
[patient] yeah usually usually about about three four days to pass it yeah
[doctor] right so this is this is the looks like this is the third day
[patient] yeah
[doctor] so we are getting close there
[patient] okay
[doctor] yeah so hopefully we can pass it but we'll i'll definitely we can take a look at it here in a second so while you are here i also wanted to check up on your your diabetes and and hypertension you have so i'm looking here at my notes and you're on two . five of norvasc for your high blood pressure when you came in today your blood pressure was a was a little bit high and i know that's probably because you are in a bunch of pain so that definitely makes sense but i think last time we talked a little bit about you getting a blood pressure cuff and taking your blood pressures regularly so those readings first off were you able to get the blood pressure cuff
[patient] i was i have n't been great about taking it but i did get the blood pressure cuff
[doctor] so the time that you did take it and i think that's something we got to work on is you've taken them i think at least three times a week i would like you to what have those been running
[patient] like the top numbers they're usually the one thirties sometimes i get i do go into one forties and once it went to like one fifty
[doctor] okay
[patient] and then the bottom number has been between seventy and eighty okay that i mean that's not too bad i think when you were first diagnosed you were up there in the
[doctor] the one eighties which was really high
[patient] right
[doctor] so let me talk a little bit also about you trying to lower your salt intake to like like twenty three hundred milligrams a a day so have you been able to do that
[patient] trying my best but doc i really like my french fries
[doctor] yeah
[patient] like
[doctor] we we all like we all like the french fries you know but you know we we we we also do n't like strokes so we do n't want to have a scope and all the all the french fries so that's something definitely i would like you to work on and do you think you'd be able to to curb that french fry habit or that bad this bad food habits by yourself or do you think you need help
[patient] yeah some help could be helpful okay yeah we can definitely get you connected with someone just to help you with your diet kinda that's the biggest thing for a lot of my patient is trying to control that diet alright
[doctor] so i also want to take a look here at your diabetes and last time you came in your a1c was a little bit higher at seven . three and you're on five hundred of metformin currently so have you been taking your blood sugars before you eat everyday
[patient] i have and those those have been pretty good they are like in the low one hundreds
[doctor] okay that that that's definitely good because when you came in i think we did a glucose test on you couple of months ago and you were around three hundred which is which is pretty up there so i'm glad that you know those levels are down and have you been taking that metformin everyday
[patient] i do
[doctor] okay
[patient] i do take it
[doctor] that that that that's really good alright so let me do a quick physical exam on you just a couple of questions before i take a look at your your abdomen and and your back talked to take a look at that that kidney stones you're having so i just want to make sure are you having any any chest pain
[patient] no chest pain
[doctor] no chest pain are you having any belly pain
[patient] the back pain is starting to kind of go down into my groin but i would n't say any back pain i mean abdominal pain
[doctor] no abdominal pain alright so let me check here i'm gon na listen to your heart real quick and so on your heart exam i do hear a grade two out of six systolic ejection murmur and that we knew about that already so not really worried about that currently listen to your lungs your lungs are clear bilaterally i do n't hear any crackles or wheezes so let me press here on your abdomen does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay i'm gon na press here on your back is that painful
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright so on your examination of your abdomen there is tenderness to palpation of the abdomen there is n't any rebound or guarding though and only there is also cva tenderness on the right on your on your flank as well and so it seems to me you know that you do have that kidney stone looks like you do have some inflammation around your kidney that's what that that's that tenderness around your cva is is telling me so let's go talk a little bit about my assessment and plan for you so you know right now because of your history of of having kidney stones you you do have a kidney stone so what we're gon na do is first off i'm gon na get you some pain medication kinda you're in a ton of pain right now i'm gon na prescribe you some oxycodone five milligrams you can take that every six to eight hours as needed for pain and so hopefully that can help you feeling better and you can continue to take that tylenol for any breakthrough pain that you're having i do wan na make sure that you're pushing fluids right now because we need to try to push that stone out that you're having just kinda clear your kidneys and that that would definitely help i also want to give you a strainer so you can strain your urine to see if you do actually pass that stone and then i'm going to refer you to urology and we're actually i'm gon na have you you even if you pass a stone in the next couple of days i want you to go anyway because it seems like you're having recurrent kidney stones and so hopefully they can help do something to to help this from happening in the future for your hypertension i'm gon na keep you on that two . five norvasc your your blood pressures look good so i'm not gon na make any changes there and then for your diabetes we'll keep you on the five hundred of metformin and i also want to give you a referral to nutrition to a dietitian and they will be able to help you with your your diet i know you said you have a few issues so you know they can possibly write a diet for you and if you follow it you know hopefully in the future we can get you off of both of these medications and get you back to normal so how does that all sound

[patient] actually it's both my elbows but my right elbow is hurting me the most
[doctor] okay and you said you lift a lot of weights
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] did you play any sports when you were younger
[patient] not anything you can think of primarily it was basketball baseball and football
[doctor] okay and did your elbows hurt at that time or is this a a new injury
[patient] it's new
[doctor] when did it start
[patient] probably year and a half ago
[doctor] okay on both elbows about a year and a half ago
[patient] yeah
[doctor] okay have you taken anything for the pain
[patient] ibuprofen eight hundred milligrams three times a day
[doctor] okay and does anything make it better or worse
[patient] the more i use my hands or my arms the more it hurts
[doctor] okay have you tried icing
[patient] yes
[doctor] does that give you any relief
[patient] no
[doctor] alright is it the inside or outside of your elbows
[patient] inside
[doctor] inside okay let's just do a quick physical exam here i'll take a look at your right elbow first
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] if i bend it this way up does it hurt it's your left does that hurt
[patient] yes
[doctor] how about this
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain with both flexion and extension
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] looks like you have little bit of limited range of motion on extension not on flexion though you said it hurts right here on the inside of your elbow
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so pain on the medial side with palpation
[patient] yes
[doctor] alright how about the outside
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with palpation outside of the elbow you have do you have normal sensation in your fingers

[doctor] pulses equal in all extremities how about the left elbow same thing if i bend it this way does that hurt
[patient] not as much
[doctor] how about this way
[patient] not as much
[doctor] alright so little bit of pain on flexion and extension little bit of limited range of motion on extension of the arm how about if you twist like you're opening a door
[patient] yes
[doctor] okay so some pain with torsion and twisting supination what about pronation
[patient] no
[doctor] no pain with pronation on the right side
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] same thing on the left
[patient] yes
[doctor] pain with supination no pain with pronation
[patient] correct
[doctor] alright so dylan it took some x-rays coming in looks like you do n't have any any fractures or any bony misalignment which i expect with this kind of injury i do think that what you have is medial epicondylitis which is
[patient] is that golfer's elbow
[doctor] yes same thing have you been golfing a lot
[patient] well not in the past year and a half i've had this for a long time
[doctor] okay also known as pictures elbow
[patient] well i have n't been pitching either
[doctor] hmmm well in any case what i'm gon na have to do is i'm gon na send you up for mri to take another look at this
[patient] mm-hmm
[doctor] that will be our next step so we'll get you scheduled for the mri probably get you in pretty quick here since we're a private practice
[patient] thank god
[doctor] yeah and once you get the mri i'll know a little bit more what i'd like to do is something called a whole blood transfusion have you heard of that before
[patient] no please tell me remind me
[doctor] yeah it should help with the healing of your elbow it's just a procedure we'll stick a needle in your elbow
[patient] you do a stick needle in my elbow
[doctor] mm-hmm and help with some of the healing of your elbow
[patient] so it's kinda like dry needling then
[doctor] no
[patient] not at all
[doctor] what is it
[patient] is it is that that thing where like you take the blood out of like say my my thigh
[doctor] mm-hmm
[patient] and then you literally inject it into my tendon
[doctor] yes
[patient] that it activates the healing
[doctor] yeah that's exactly what it is
[patient] interesting cool
[doctor] yeah
[patient] maybe i have heard about that
[doctor] we've we've had some really good responses from other patients on it so hopefully i mean that should be a good solution for you since you've been having issues with this
[patient] i'm excited

[doctor] okay now if it's okay with you i would like to do a quick physical exam i reviewed your vitals and everything looks good blood pressure was one eighteen over seventy two heart rate was fifty eight respiratory rate was fourteen you are afebrile and you had an o2 saturation of ninety nine percent on room air on your heart exam your regular of rate and rhythm do n't appreciate any clicks rubs or murmurs no ectopic beats noted there on auscultation listening to your lungs lungs are clear and equal bilaterally so you're moving good air i'd like to do a focused foot exam on your left foot so i do see some bruising on the bottom of your foot and on the top of your foot as well now there is associated swelling and i do appreciate tenderness to palpation of your midfoot and you are positive for the piano key test on a neurovascular exam of your left foot you have a brisk capillary refill of less than three seconds dorsalis pedis pulse is intact and strong and you do have motor and sensation that it's intact to light touch now i would like to do a review of the diagnostic imaging that you had before you came in so i do notice a subtle dorsal displacement of the base of the second metatarsal with a three millimeter separation of the first and second metatarsal bases and the presence of a bony fragment in the lisfranc joint space so lem me talk to you a little bit about my assessment and plan now for for the first concern of right foot pain your right foot pain is due to a lisfranc fracture which is a fracture to one of your second metatarsal bones at the top of your foot where the metatarsals meet your cuboids now there are ligaments at the top of your foot so i'm gon na be ordering an mri to assess for injury to any of these ligaments now based on your exam and from what i'm seeing on your x-ray you're most likely going to need surgery of that foot now the surgery will place the bones back in their proper position and using plates and screws will hold them there while they heal and this is gon na allow those bones and ligaments to heal properly it is a day surgery and you will be able to go home the same day and then i'm going to have you follow up with me here in the clinic you'll be in a cast and you will need to use crutches and you will not be able to use that left foot for about six to eight weeks now after that six to eight weeks you will gradually start walking on your foot based on how you tolerate it and we'll see how you do at that point so i do believe you're gon na need surgery i i'm recommending this because there are significant complications to your foot if we do not do this poor bone and ligament healing can lead to losing the arch of your foot and you're becoming flat-footed you also have a high likelihood of developing arthritis in that foot so what i'm gon na do unfortunately you'll be out the rest of the season but we are gon na get you fixed up and ready for next season if you're okay with all of this i'm gon na have the nurse come in and get you started on your paperwork and then i will see you on monday morning and we will get your foot taken care of

Have you tried anything which has made the headache better?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[patient] Uh, no.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] Did that help?[doctor] OK, all right. And except for the headaches, any other symptoms at all?[doctor] So, example any, problems your eyesight or your vision?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no.

Are you otherwise fit and well, Adriana?[doctor] You fit and well? <UNIN/>, do you have any other medical history?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Any history of migraines at all?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK. Um, fine. I'll ask you a bit more about that in just a second. Before I go any further, can I ask, do you take any regular medication?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Are you on the pill?[doctor] OK. Do you have any allergies to any medications?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] OK. So you mentioned your mother and sister both have migraines.[doctor] Are they, is that normally well-controlled or are they um, having difficulty, controlling their symptoms?[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] Mm-hmm, OK.[doctor] Ohh right, OK, fine. Um, socially, tell me a bit more about your life, outside of, um, outside of, work. So <UNIN/>, who lives at home with you?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. Excellent. And are you working at the moment? You mentioned this <UNIN/>, impacting on your work.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Mmm. OK. Do you wear glasses?[doctor] Have you had any, uh, have you had any recent eye check, done? Eye test?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, all right.

Do you drink or smoke at all?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] But only socially?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Right. Now um, Adriana, do you have any ideas as to what could be causing your symptoms? Have you, have you read anything online, or spoken to people?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Mm-hmm.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Mmm.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK. Is it anything in particular you were hoping I could do for you today?[doctor] OK.[doctor] How many tablets did you take of Ibuprofen?[doctor] Three a day, OK. All right. Um, so uh, Adriana, so um, really what I think is going on here. I <UNIN/>, uh, unfortunately I do think this could be, a headache very similar to a migraine.[doctor] Um, the reason I say that is because the history is very suggestive of it, given your mum and your sister also migraines. I think it's something for us to think about.[doctor] Um, now I'm not saying it's gonna, keep happening, but, it may just be a one-off. But it's certainly worth treating it today stronger analgesia or painkillers.[doctor] Um, now moving forward, we have some options which we can discuss. Uh, you tried the Ibuprofen. Now, my only worry is, I'm not sure whether you're taking, the correct dose. You can take up to two tablets, three times a day.[doctor] So, so <UNIN/>, there's definitely room for, improvement there. Or, I can prescribe you something stronger, like Naproxen, which is another anti-inflammatory, which can be helpful.[doctor] Um, we can also add in other, painkillers like, Paracetamol, or Codeine. Which might be helpful as well.[doctor] OK. And I think it's <UNIN/>, certainly worth looking into that, so I can give you a <UNIN/>, prescription for that today. Um, with regards to um, the next few days. It may be worth keeping a headache diary so we can try and work out what's, you know, if there's any triggers which could be causing your headaches to become worse.[doctor] And, and, you know I'd like you to come back and see me, in about uh, a week's time, week to two weeks' time.[doctor] If you are having <UNIN/>, more frequent episodes of these type of headaches. We can think about giving you medications as, prophylactic. Which basically means, medications to stop you from having these headaches on a regular basis. But we can have that discussion next time.[doctor] OK. In the meantime if your headaches aren't getting any better, or they're getting worse. Um, you know, I want you to give me a call, or come back and see me sooner. OK?[doctor] So, if you're having any problems with your vision, or weakness in your arms and legs, or you're just not feeling very well. Just give me a call, and come back and see me.[doctor] All right?[doctor] Great. Well, have a good day.[doctor] Bye.","S (Subjective):

Um.[doctor] What, what about smoking and alcohol, sir?[doctor] Do you, you do either?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> roughly on average, how many you would drink a week?[doctor] Well, whatever you drink.

I think you know what you essentially have is a bit of a, a bit of a viral illness perhaps, a bit of a, maybe early signs of a flu, um.[doctor] Which I think should, settle down, um, really on it's own, uh, over time. Um, things to you know, you, you can do, help yourself you know, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, stay rested, drink plenty of fluids.[doctor] Um, if you are, if you are feeling hot and cold and sweaty, taking regular Paracetamol would be beneficial. Um, you mentioned feeling a bit short of breath. Um, I'm a little bit on the edge about giving you antibiotics. I don't think you've got a chest infection, but what we could think about is giving you a.[doctor] A script for antibiotics, which maybe use in next, twenty four to forty eight hours, if your symptoms don't get better.[doctor] Yeah.[doctor] Yeah, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, I will, yeah, I'll, I'll give you a script today, give it about twenty four to forty eight hours. If you feel like you're still feeling breathless and, run-down, I think there's no harm in starting a course of antibiotics, something like Amoxicillin.[doctor] One tablet, three times a day. Um, uh, and <UNIN/>, if you're still not better by next week, come back and see me, we can have another look.[doctor] Exactly.[doctor] Yes, absolutely.[doctor] Great, well, I'm, glad I could help.[doctor] And um, I wish you and your football team all the best.[doctor] OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, all the best.

However, I would like you to be assessed in a clinic today.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK? I <UNIN/>,would like you to come to one of my clinics. I would like a GP to assess you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> what you're, what you're describing might be something called Bell's Palsy. OK? Um,[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] We can go into that, explaining what that is, if um, if that's confirmed on, on physical examination. But um, that's not usually a <UNIN/> life-threatening problem.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] But, um, part of the reason why I'd like you to come in, it's just that we can do a, a what we call a, a neurological examination just to make sure there's nothing else going on, and confirm <UNIN/> that might be the diagnosis. Have a look, have a look inside the ear, see if there's any, <UNIN/>, anything to see within the ear.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] So, um, um, so, in answer to your question. No, I don't think that you need to worry about that, I <UNIN/>,  think you know <UNIN/>, preliminarily I can, I can reassure you.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] However, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, in order to definitively reassure you, I, I think you need a physical examination today, OK. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, so what I wanna do, is I'm gonna send a message to our admin team, I'll ask them, to book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, within Central London. OK, and then you can ring the <UNIN/>, the support team number, I'll leave that number in your notes. And you can ring them after five minutes, and then they'll slot you in to a place that's convenient for you, OK.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] All right. So, someone <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> will see you, and hopefully you will be able to reassure further but, please make sure the appointment gets done today.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] All right then. OK. Nice to see you. Take care.[doctor] Bye.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear.

OK. <UNIN/>, and um, has this happened before?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] Sure, OK. Uh, and can I um, can I just double-check? Has anyone in your family, got any, kind of rheumatology, diseases, like rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus or anything like that?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[patient] Uh, no.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Sure. <UNIN/>, so you know you said you think you've got <UNIN/>, uh, osteoarthritis. Has anyone ever told you that? Have you ever seen a doctor who's confirmed that, and told you you've got osteoarthritis?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] OK. <UNIN/>, was that a GP or a specialist or, was it, a physiotherapist?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] GP, OK, all right. Um, look can I just, uh, sorry can I just double-check how old you are please?[doctor] Fifty three, OK. Fantastic. All right. Um, and, do you have any other illnesses at all?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods.

Well done that's <UNIN/>, it's good that you're doing that on a regular basis. OK. Um, and um, uh, can I, is it possible for me to have a look at your elbow, now?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] OK, good, bear with me one second.[doctor] Right, OK. And if you can just raise your elbow up a little bit like that, a bit higher, so I can just see the underside. OK, fantastic, all right.[doctor] And then, just, bring it round to this side, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, I can see other side. OK, fantastic. All right. And if you can just touch the tip of your elbow with your fingers.[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] There's, <UNIN/>, is it, is it hot, compared to the surrounding skin, the adjacent skin?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] It's a bit warmer. OK. Um, and um, is it very tender when you're pressing on that nerve? Is it, if you, if you give it a press, does it hurt you at all?[patient] No.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. All right. Um, well, um, I noticed the skin was a bit dry, <UNIN/>, on the tip of the elbow. Do you, do you have dry skin anywhere else on the body?[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, do you <UNIN/>, do you suffer from eczema at all?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] No. Alright.[doctor] OK. So um, what I think we should do, with regards to your elbow problem[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] OK. Is um, I think, it would be worthwhile. <UNIN/>, this seems like uh, what we call the Bursitis. OK. So, that's an inflammation of one of the fluid sacs around the joint.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Um, what I think we should do is, I think you should be on some anti-inflammatory medication, in the, in the first instance.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] And, as well as that, what I would like to do, is to get some blood tests done, to check for other types of uh, causes of joint swelling. K?[doctor] So, um, what we're going to do is, we're going to arrange some, um, blood test forms to be sent out to your house. And, there'll be instructions within that pack, about where to go to get those blood tests done.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] And, that will involve you, um, having some tests done to check for inflammatory markers, infection, rheumatological antibodies.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[doctor] So we'll do a full screen, and also check for things like Gout as well, OK. Um.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] The time frame for that, will be um, the results will come back to us after about five or six days. Um.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] From now, but it may take time for the form to come out to you. And if you get the form get the blood tests done straight away, by the time that we're expecting result back, you know one or two days after that, we're looking maybe six days.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And, what I would suggest, is, we can arrange a follow-up appointment for you, in one of our clinics, where we can have a look at your joint, feel it, we can review the blood test.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Uh, we can um, get a gauge as to, uh, what's going on. Now in terms of your joint right now,[patient] Okay.[doctor] It doesn't look like, to me that's something called, excuse me, septic arthritis. So, we're worried sometimes that someone might have an acutely infected joint.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, and uh, your, your joint doesn't look like that.[doctor] However, if your, the elbow was to become very red, very painful, uh, and the redness was to spread or become uh, you know more intense. Then you need to get on the phone or get, have a video appointment <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, with one of us as soon as possible.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] 'Cause that would be an emergency. That would require more immediate assessment, more immediate treatment. OK?[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] No. I, I don't think this is anything dangerous. <UNIN/> don't need to worry. OK? What I'm doing, is I'm just outlining the worst case scenario if things were to, to develop. K? So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, this, this is not the case right now. Right now, it looks quite straightforward.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] It's nothing <UNIN/>, sinister or life-threatening. Um, what I'm doing is I'm just saying, in case things worsen, these are the things that we'd be looking out for, and this is what we have to do. But you don't have that now, thankfully, and I don't think you're going to have it.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] But I'm just saying, the what if scenario. Is that OK?[doctor] All right. Did you have any questions that you wanted to ask me?[doctor] OK, all right. Um.[doctor] OK. So, I, I would take Ibuprofen regularly, OK. You can get that <UNIN/>, over the counter. Um, that's four hundred milligrams, two times a day. And you should take, take that after food, not on an empty stomach. If you get any heartburn, stop taking it. OK.[doctor] All right. So, what I wanna do is, I'll get the forms sent out to you.[doctor] And, um, we are going to arrange a, a follow-up appointment.[doctor] Maybe within a um, actually you know, the follow-up appointment doesn't have to be face-to-face, if it's more convenient for you do, to do it over the phone, we can do that over the phone, uh, over video. We can do that as well, that's, that's your call. But you contact us, <UNIN/>, after you've had the blood test done, and we can review things then, OK.[doctor] Sure, sure that's a good idea. All right then, OK. Um, take care then. So <UNIN/>, look just leave that with me, I'll sort all those bits and pieces out, and then we'll get them sent out to you, and then we'll, we'll um, review you after the tests, things goes well, OK.[doctor] All right then. Take care then, all the best. Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

So, apart from the uh, the heart, the heart problems, the heart failure, any other problems I should be aware of?[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK. Um, do you take any regular medications, apart from your <UNIN/> diuretics that you're taking? And do you know which ones?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Do you know which dose you're taking?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work.

And is there anything in the family that's, uh, that, that's uh, that's important for me to know? Any family history of medical problems, heart problems, lung problems?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. And, um, how old was your father when he passed away?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Early sixties, OK. Alright. Anything else I should be aware of?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Is your mother still with us?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, alright. Um, and socially, sir, just tell me a bit more about your situation at home. Who lives at home with you?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] You've got two cats. OK, great. Do they have names?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Um, so it's just you and your cats. And um, in terms of day to day, are you working at the moment?[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. And how is that? Is that quite stressful, long hours?[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] Mm.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Yeah, that's certainly a consideration, isn't it? So let's, let's try and get you better soon, so it doesn't have any um, impact on your, on your job.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Uh, and do you find yourself doing a lot of anti-social hours? Do you <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, do you do a lot of night driving, weekend driving?[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK, alright. And what about smoking and alcohol? So, 'cause <UNIN/> that can sometimes be very important when it comes to heart problems. Do you, do you smoke at all?[doctor] So, you used to smoke?[doctor] And how many did you smoke a day, on average?[doctor] Um, and how many, how many years was that for?[doctor] OK. And what about the stopping? That must have been difficult for you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> stopping. Um, and what, what about alcohol?[doctor] OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise, sir?[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Right, OK. And certainly now your symptoms, you, you're, you said you're feeling more breathless even walking to the <UNIN/> uh, to the shop, she said.[doctor] Um, right. Ohh um, based on your, based on you history, and having listened to your story, I, I wonder whether you've had a flare-up of your heart failure, sir. Um,[doctor] Which can sometimes happen. Um, um, and uh,[doctor] It's <UNIN/>. So, it seems like your heart's not pumping as well as it should be. Um, and obviously having diagnosed with heart failure, there's obviously[doctor] Um, that's the first thing that comes to my mind. Um, now there's a couple of options <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> move forward. Um,[doctor] Given that you're otherwise well at the moment, and having examined you, your chest, and your saturations and blood pressure are all OK,[doctor] I'm quite happy to increase your dose of Furosemide. Maybe, rather than one tablet a day, we can do two tablets a day, for the first few days.[doctor] Um, and see, and see how you're getting on.[doctor] Uh,[doctor] I think, I think, it's, <UNIN/> it's, it's definitely worth treating your symptoms. But what we should also think about is maybe doing a couple of other tests, like a blood test, and maybe an echocardiogram of your heart, to see how well your heart's pumping.[doctor] Is that something you've had before? Yeah, so um, an <UNIN/>, it's a, it's a general scan of your heart. You might have had this done before, when you were diagnosed. And it's just to get a good[doctor] Sorry?[doctor] You remember that. OK, fine. That's something I can organize for you today. And, and that might take a week or two weeks for that to be organized. But, I think certainly in the meantime, let's, um,[doctor] Let's, let's get a blood test done. We can check your um, you know your full blood count, look for signs of anemia. We can have a check of your kidney function.[doctor] Um, and we can definitely increase your um, your Furosemide, uh, to you know, one tablet twice a day.[doctor] But I really like, would like you to come back and see me in about a week's time, see how you're getting on. That sound reasonable?[doctor] And of course, in the meantime if you are getting more unwell, feel like you're getting more breathless, or you're having any other symptoms like chest pain, or palpitations or dizziness, then, uh, you know <UNIN/> I want you to give me a call sooner than that, and we can have a chat on the phone as well.[doctor] OK? Do you have any questions for me?[doctor] Great, and then well I wish you all the best! Have a good day. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Thank you.","S (Subjective):

Um if next week you're still not better, I'd like you to come back and see me.[doctor] Um is that clear? Does that, does that make, does that make <UNIN/>[doctor] Yeah, yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> and things to look out for if you're really not getting better, if you if you have a high fever, or your breathing is becoming a bit more labored, or chest pain, I'd like you to come back and see me much sooner, give me a call.

Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] <UNIN/> What I'm trying get at is whether um, uh there's any chance you could be pregnant at all. Uh, I know you're on the pill, but um we're we, nonetheless we do have to ask. Um when was your last, when was your last period?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Two weeks ago OK, all right. Just something for us, to bear in mind, if your symptoms don't get any better OK, um.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Fine, in terms of your general health otherwise at the moment are you, uh eating and drinking OK?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] <UNIN/> Sure, well thanks for sharing with me. Um, so, I, I don't think  it's <UNIN/> is related to your symptoms, I think it probably just pure pure coincidence, um.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] But, uh, you know I do strongly advise you to you know, um, make it a regular habit if you can. Um, just for your, just for your general health moving forwards, OK?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[doctor] Um, fine. Moving on, in terms of your health otherwise, do you have any other medical conditions <UNIN/> , apart from the IBS, is there anything else I should be aware of?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] No, OK great. And what about any medications that you take on a regular basis, apart from the, um, combined pill?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> was it, yeah OK.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK, and is that for the cramps, the crampy pain?[doctor] Yeah OK, and do you have any allergy to any medications?[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/> OK, OK, OK.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Ritib, OK sure, I'll make a note of that. Um, in terms of family history, any history of problems with the bladder or the kidneys?[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] No, or <UNIN/> generally anything else, good. And socially, tell me a bit more about your home situation, who's at home with you?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <UNIN/> Very good.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] Great, and what are you studying at university?[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] English, OK good, and how are you enjoying your course?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Good.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Very good, very good, good. Um, in terms of smoking and alcohol, do you, do you participate in either?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> O K[doctor] OK, what, what's made you have your first joint last week? Was  <UNIN/>[doctor] OK.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Sure, uh, and obviously as your doctor I'm here to look after you so yeah I I would strongly recommend you, you know, to avoid if you can. Great, um, fine so, at this stage I wouldn't normally examine you, but I think based on your story I think, um, you know, uh, I'm reassured.[doctor] But the fact that I, I I think it's, um, probably just a simple what we'd say a UTI or a cystitis, bladder infection.[doctor] Uh, you know you haven't got any other symptoms that, suggest to me that there's anything to worry about, so things like fevers and back pain.[doctor] Um, would be more worrying for me to hear. Um, so it's something we can treat quite readily with antibiotics. Um, so we've got a choice of two antibiotics something called Trimethoprim or, Nitrofurantoin which is a three day course.[doctor] And normally they're usually quite effective, um, for your symptoms. It's probably worth giving us a urine sample today as well if you can, so we can send it off to the lab.[doctor] And see exactly what's going on there. Um, start the antibiotics, make sure you're well hydrated, drink plenty of fluids.[doctor] Um, if you are having some pain, simple Paracetamol, um, would probably be advisable.[doctor] Um, we'll see what the urine sample shows. Um, and if it is indeed positive, we'll know which antibiotics are the right ones.[doctor] Um, but if things still are still not getting any better next week come back and see me, and we can have another look again.[doctor] So if <UNIN/> I'll give yeah no it's a well uh so yeah good question, so I will give you <UNIN/> I will organise uh for you to come in, and drop off a sample at one of our practices, um which we can test there and then, at the urine <UNIN/> and send it off to the lab uh we can back in touch with you with the results.[doctor] OK, do bear in mind those symptoms I mentioned about the fever and the back pain and vomiting. If you have any of those give me a call, OK?[doctor] All right, OK. Have a good day. Thank you, bye bye.","S (Subjective):

primock_/day2_consultation01,"[doctor] Hi, there. Good morning![patient] Hello, how are you?[doctor] Uh, I'm Dr. Dean Mesa from Babylon.[doctor] <UNIN/> Can you hear me OK?[patient] Oh hey, um, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities.[doctor] Yeah, OK, great. Well, nice to see you this morning. Um, before we start your appointment, could I confirm your full name and date of birth please?[doctor] That's perfect, thank you, John. Um, are you in a private place where you're OK to speak at the moment?[doctor] OK, great. So, um, tell me what's been going on. <UNIN/> You've been saying there's a problem with your hearing. Is that right?[patient] Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, uh and like some pain in my, like, lower stomach?[doctor] Right, OK. How long has this been going on for?[doctor] Six weeks, OK. Um, and before that have you had any hearing problem at all?[patient] Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah.[patient] No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.[doctor] Right, OK, OK. And, um, in this six week period, have you had anything else happen? Have you had any other ear symptoms at all?[patient] Yep.[patient] So <UNIN/> in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.[patient] Uh, on the left side.[doctor] Right, OK. Uh, uh, um,  just to clarify, the difficulty you've got in hearing, is that both ears or just the left ear?[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[doctor] Alright, so your right ear is fine.[doctor] OK. So you've had ringing, difficulty hearing in your left ear, and feeling slightly sick.[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[doctor] Um, that's been, on and off for the six weeks, or is it continuous there throughout that six weeks?[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Right, OK. Um, and, um, have you had any pain from the ear at all?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] OK. Any discharge coming out of the ear? No, OK. Um,  have, have you been experiencing any fever?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] Right, OK. And, um, has your ear been itchy at all?[doctor] OK. Now, do you use cotton ball buds to try and <UNIN/> clean out wax from your ears?[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] No, OK. Well, you're right, you should, you shouldn't be doing that. <UNIN/> Doesn't clean up wax, it pushes it back in. Alright, um, the first thing that we need to do is we need to get someone to have a look inside your ear.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] 'K. I'm just exclude the simple things. Simple things <UNIN/> might be wax. You know. Someone might have impacted wax, blocking the tube going into the eardrum, which can[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] lead to muffled hearing. Um, if that's the case, that that's something that's easy fixable. But, um, so we need to exclude that first.[doctor] and then after that, we can consider other potential possibilities. Um, and for that we need to have a look inside the ear drum.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] So, um, what I think we could do is, um, maybe if we book you in for a face-to-face appointment in one of our clinics. It's not an emergency.[patient] Yep.[doctor] It can be done within the next four, five days or so, OK? And then, um, what I'll do, I'll send a message to our admin team.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] I'll ask them to slot you into the clinic, one of our clinics in that time frame. You can come in and one of the GPs will just have a quick look in the ear and figure out[doctor] whether there's physical blockage or whether there's something else going on, OK? Um, can I just double check, the dizziness that you've been getting, um, how severe is it?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Right, right, OK. Have, have you had any chest pain with it?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] No. Any palpitations, heart beating fast?[doctor] OK, fine, alright. Um, so <UNIN/> let's get your ear checked out. I think that will be the, the most sensible thing to do. And then after that, we can, we'll be a step closer to figuring out which way we <UNIN/>[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] <UNIN/> It might be that there's a problem inside the drum or the balance system within the ear. But, we just need to exclude whether there's <UNIN/>[doctor] physical blockage first and trying to deal with that if that's the case, OK? Um, but[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] <UNIN/> The ringing that you got, that you've got, it's something called Tinnitus. OK? Um[doctor] and Tinnitus is something actually that medicine doctors, we don't really understand it fully. We haven't[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Uh, <UNIN/> people can't give you a specific cause for why some patients get Tinnitus and some patients don't. It can be triggered by a wide range of different things, and in fact[patient] No.[doctor] I'm glad that you've mentioned that. What I might do, in the time between now and when you come for the appointment, I'm going to, uh, put[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] paste the link for a leaflet about Tinnitus, um, in the notes for this appointment. I'd really appreciate it if you could start reading about it.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK. And often that, that, uh, awareness of what it is and what the treatment options are, and there are limited options[doctor] um that helps us in terms of conversation about what we do next, if your ear is clear, OK? So, um, I'm going to paste a link to that, um, and you can read about that and[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] what we'll do is we'll see you in about four, five days time. It won't be with me, it'll be another GP[doctor] but they'll have my notes and they'll know exactly what, what my question is, which is just to check your ears. Is that OK?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Alright, great. So, um, bear with me five minutes and then you can ring the support team, I'll leave the number in the notes for this appointment. Ring them, and then they'll slot you in, OK?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Alright. <UNIN/> If there's any problem, any issues <UNIN/> between now and when the clinic appointment is, just book another appointment and you can speak to one of us over video, OK?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] Alright then. Take care. Nice to see you this morning. OK. Bye bye.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.","S (Subjective):

Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] OK. And do you have any allergies to any medications?[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK. And what about any family history? Do you have any family history of bowel problems? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Yeah, yeah. So what I mean by bowel is the whole gut.

Do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] And alcohol?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] But not <UNIN/>.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Well thank you for <UNIN/> me. That's really helpful to know. So um, Dan, just as a a conclusion, uh um, just to wrap it all up, I think your symptoms are suggestive of something called gastroenteritis.[doctor] bit of a basic infection of your tummy. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. There's nothing to worry about. Uh um uh uh I suspect this will just settle down in the next few days.[doctor] Just like you did for you brother. Drink, make sure you drink plenty of fluids, OK? And you can <UNIN/>[doctor] Right.[doctor] <UNIN/> fluid is probably best. But I am obviously worried about the fact that you are losing minerals and vitamins. Um so, you can get things like Diarolyte, which is um, a fluid replacement you can get from the pharmacy. It's probably worth <UNIN/> uh recommending that.[doctor] <UNIN/> no, you can just get that over the counter.[doctor] Um, you can try just you know regular Paracetamol if you are feeling feverish. But if your symptoms aren't settling down in the next couple of days, so forty eight hours, I want you to give me a call back.[doctor] Because um, you know if you are getting dehydrated then we need to do further investigations, OK? But I think let's, let's see how you are in the next one to two days.[doctor] And uh, we'll catch up soon, OK?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> clear fluids. You can use soft diet, things like soup, mash. And then gradually build up, um as much as your body can tolerate.[doctor] Um, but let's try and keep yourself well-hydrated first, OK?[doctor] Absolutely. If you are having, if you've got a bit of tummy pain, if you're feeling feverish, then I think Paracetamol is very sensible.[doctor] OK? Try and <UNIN/> avoid alcohol if you can.[doctor] OK. Alright then.[doctor] Thank you for your help.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Thank you. Bye bye now.","S (Subjective):

And can you describe the pain to me?[patient] No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.[patient] Yep.[patient] So <UNIN/> in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Just in, just below your belly button you uh, mentioned.[patient] Uh, on the left side.[doctor] OK. Um, and is the pain constant, or does it come and go?[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] <UNIN/>. Mm-hmm. OK. Um, and with the pain have you noticed any other symptoms, at all? So, for example, let's, let's focus first on your bowels. Are your bowels working OK?[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. So you've got no other symptoms, like diarrhea or loose stools?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] No.[doctor] OK. And, what about your waterworks? Are you passing urine OK?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[patient] Uh, no.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] Mm.[doctor] And when you mentioned pink urine, do you, was there any blood at all in your urine? Or was it difficult to say?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] OK, alright. But otherwise, it doesn't hurt, uh, or or or sting, when you pass urine?[doctor] OK.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] OK. Um, OK. And um, moving on to <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> other symptoms, have you noticed any vomiting, or feeling nauseous at all?[patient] Yep.[doctor] No vomiting. Any temperatures or fevers?[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK, fine. Um, uh, uh, and Kim, have to ask um, uh <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> all all all <UNIN/> patients. This this question is about your cycle, if you don't mind me asking. Um, are you currently um, are you currently sexually active?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] OK. So you've had no other partner since then.[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] OK. Um, uh, and do you use any contraception at all?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] At the moment, OK, fine. Um, are you still having periods?[doctor] When was your last period?[doctor] Two week scare, OK. So, is there any chance you could be pregnant? I know you've got an implement in there, but is there any chance you could potentially be pregnant? It's something for us to think about <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Yeah, OK. Well it's something for us to think about. Um, uh, maybe worth taking a pregnancy test later on, just to confirm that. Um[patient] No.[doctor] OK. And, and so, just to summarize so far, if you don't mind, it's really for the last couple of days, it's tummy pain that's really affected you, mainly lower down towards your belly button. It's quite burning, you said. It's getting worse. Um, you noticed some pink urine.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Um, but no burning or stinging pain when you pass urine. Your bowels are working OK.[doctor] You've felt a little bit nauseous, um, and feeling hot and sweaty. Have I got that all right?[doctor] Is there anything else, perhaps, that you feel like you should share with me at this stage, anything that might be important?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Yeah, OK. Um, tell me, tell me a bit more about your um, medical history otherwise. Are you normally fit and well?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Um, have you had anything like this before in the past? Any similar symptoms?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] No, OK. Um[doctor] Fine. Um, any other family history I should be aware of? Anything relevant, family, uh related to bowels, maybe related to <UNIN/> history?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Alright. Um, and socially, just tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's at home with you?[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. Um, and uh, are you currently working?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] What do you do for work?[doctor] OK. Um[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <UNIN/> OK. Um, Do you smoke at all, Kim?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?[doctor] No, OK.[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. Um, just before I go to the examination, I just want to go through just some few screening questions if that's OK, yes or no.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Uh, we've, we've covered the majority of them already. Uh, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything else.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, how's your, <UNIN/> how's your chest? How's your breathing? Um, any <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> OK. Any uh, funny heartbeats or rhythms, palpitations?[doctor] OK. Any headaches? Any problems with your vision?[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] No, OK. Alright. Um,[patient] Yep.[doctor] Fine, OK. Um, So really just uh, moving on, um,[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And so based, based on your story really, uh, uh Kim it's, it's <UNIN/> it's difficult. <UNIN/> it's it's um, you know you've got some tummy pain. You don't exactly know what's causing it. It could be a few different things that could be causing your pain.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Could just be a, you know, could just be a urine infection, for example. Could just be something related to your gut. Um, could just be something related to your, you know, a pregnancy-related cause. Um, and so it's probably worth doing some tests initially.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] to try and rule out um, what's going on here. Um, which I can organize for you today.[doctor] Um, and basically those tests, we,  we'll have a better idea in terms of how we should proceed. But certainly, it <UNIN/> if it's been going on for the last couple of days, um,[doctor] Uh, you know, it's probably maybe worth empirically treating you for a maybe urine infection. And, so it's an <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Yeah, absolutely. So, um I think it's certainly worth, you know covering you with some antibiotics today.[doctor] Uh, but i still want you to bear in mind, you know, have a pregnancy test done to make sure we're not missing anything else here.[doctor] And, um, and I want you to kind of really come back and see me in a few days time, if your symptoms are not getting any better, or indeed if they're getting worse.[doctor] So, things to look out for would be, you know, worsening tummy pain, um, if you're feeling really hot or sweaty, your temperature's not coming down um, vomiting et cetera. Does that make sense?[doctor] OK. Um, you can try just regular painkillers, uh, Paracetamol would be advisable. Um, make sure you drink plenty of fluids.[doctor] You can try some cranberry juice as well, which uh, can sometimes help with your urine symptoms.[doctor] Um, take the antibiotics, uh, and give me a call, you know, if you are worried about anything else.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Yeah, if I send it straight to your pharmacy, start the antibiotics today, something called Trimethoprim.

Does the pain move anywhere else, for example towards your back?[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[doctor] Okay, fine. And you mentioned you've been feeling quite weak and shaky as well. What do you mean by shaky? Do you mean you've been having, uh have you been feeling feverish, for example?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] <UNIN/>[doctor] You measure your temperature then?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] Okay. Okay. Any other symptoms like sweating, or um, night sweats? No? And, uh, any vomiting at all?[patient] Uh, no.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] You stopped vomiting, okay. And was your vomit, I know it's not a nice thing to talk about, but was it just normal food colour <UNIN/> Yeah. And there was no blood in your vomit, is that right?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] No, okay. Um, and um, any any other symptoms at all? So you mentioned tummy pain, you mentioned diarrhea, you mentioned your vomiting, uh, anything else that comes to mind?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] <UNIN/> Okay.[doctor] Okay, so you're drinking fluids.

Um, and sir <UNIN/> these started three days ago the symptoms. Are you aware of any triggers which may have caused the symptoms uh to kick on. So for example, think like takeaway foods or eating out or being around other people with similar symptoms.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Okay.[doctor] Do you remember where you ate?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] Okay. Anyone else unwell with similar symptoms?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Okay, okay. Fine. Um, alright. And uh, in terms of your <UNIN/>, your overall health, are you normally fit and well? Or, uh[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Okay. And, is your asthma well-controlled?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Fine. And you don't have any other tummy problem, bowel problems I should be aware of?[patient] No.[doctor] No, okay. Um, and <UNIN/> apart from the inhalers, do you take any other medications?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Okay, fine. And in terms of just your day to day life, you said it's been affecting your life, um, in what way has it been affecting your life?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Okay.[doctor] Yeah.[doctor] And have you, are you currently working at the moment? <UNIN/>[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Would, would work.[doctor] Okay. Have you been going into work the last three days, or have you been at home?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] <UNIN/> okay. That must be difficult for you then.[doctor] <UNIN/> fine. And you said, you mentioned you live with your wife and two children, is that right?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Right, alright. Um, just a couple of other question we need to ask, sir.

Um.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] At this stage, uh, what, what we'd recommend is just what we say conservative management. So, um, I don't think you need anything like antibiotics. It's really just, um, making sure you're well hydrated, so drinking fluids.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Um, <UNIN/> there are things like Dioralyte you can get from the pharmacy, which uh it's um it helps helps replenish your minerals and vitamins.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Um, and if you are having vomiting diarrhea I would say recommend that in the first, you know, first couple of days.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <UNIN/> If you are feeling feverish and weak, eh taking some paracetamol, uh, <UNIN/> two tablets up to four times a day for the first few days can also help.[patient] Yep.[doctor] I will certainly advise you to take some time off work, actually I know you're quite keen to work but I would say the next two, two to three days as the infection clears from your system to take some time off and rest.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, I'll admit if your symptoms haven't got better, you know, in in three to four days, I'd like to come and see you again. <UNIN/>[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] Because if it is ongoing then we have to wonder whether something else caused your symptoms.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Uh, and we may need to do further tests like um taking a sample of your stool so we can test that.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Um, etcetera etcetera.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] How's that sound?[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> Do you have any questions for me?[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Okay, and is uh is the treatment plan clear?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Great. Well, I wish you all the best.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] <UNIN/> Thank you. Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

Which is very common in, particularly people in your in your in your field, who are using cleaning products, not using gloves. And sometimes you get a bit of reaction between the chemicals and your skin.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, so moving forward there's a couple of options. So firstly,  what we try and do is, you know, avoid the triggers. In your case, I strongly recommend that you wear gloves when cleaning at all times.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. And in terms of helping your dryness and the cracking of your skin, um we can try some steroid creams to help with the inflammation.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Yep.[doctor] As well as some stronger emollients, um which you really need to kind of coat on, three four times a day, for the next couple of weeks, just to help with the moisturizing of your skin.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Um if it still hasn't got better in about a week, two weeks time, I really need you to come back and see me again. And we can maybe think about other things we can give to you.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Is that all clear?[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Great. Do you have any questions for me?[doctor] <UNIN/> I'll I'll I'll do a <UNIN/> prescription for you now, and send it over to your pharmacy.[doctor] OK.[doctor] I think <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> I think minimum couple of weeks. Uh ten days to fourteen days. Um and if it still hasn't got better, or indeed if it's getting worse, like if it's spreading, or dryness is getting worse, come back and see me sooner.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Great. Thank you Laura.

You, you said you've been having weird symptoms for about a month.[doctor] <UNIN/>, so, what has been happening from the beginning of the month? What else has been happening?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] Right, OK.[doctor] Um, and, um.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] You know, <UNIN/>, your colleague said you've, you've not been walking normally.[doctor] Do you feel anything different, on either side, in terms of your legs? Can <UNIN/>, have you noticed anything different?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] Right, OK.[doctor] And.[doctor] You know you, the abnormal gait. Has that been present, outside of these episodes?[doctor] Right, <UNIN/>.[doctor] All right, OK. Um, and, these, these episodes. How often have they been happening?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] Right, OK. And, how long have these episodes been going on for? When, when did it all start? Was it a month ago?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Right, OK.[doctor] OK. And, along with these symptoms, of the weakness and numbness. Do you have any other symptoms at the same time? Like swallowing, or difficulty speaking, or vision problems?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Right. Is that during these episodes, or outside of these episodes?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Do you have any difficulty swallowing at all?[doctor] <UNIN/>. During the episodes, do you have any difficulty swallowing?[patient] No.[doctor] OK. What about, <UNIN/> um, difficulty speaking during these episodes? Any, any issues with that at all?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] OK. And any visual problems during these episodes?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK, all right. Now um, can I just ask? <UNIN/>, has, uh, is there any history of stroke, or mini-strokes in your family?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Right, OK.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Um, and, uh, how about yourself? Have you had any history of, mini-strokes or anything like that, along those lines? I know you're quite young.[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[doctor] Good, excellent. So you had a, a blood test done. And did they check for diabetes as well?[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Fantastic, OK. Now, do you have any other illnesses at all?[doctor] No. Are you on any medication?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. So, so, why is that? Why do you take that?[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Do, have you ever told a doctor before, your GP, that you're on Aspirin?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. Uh, and, has any GP ever spoken to you about, the risks of Aspirin, and whether you should be on it? Or have you not <UNIN/>, told the <UNIN/>, the GP in the past?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] You haven't, OK. Um, all right. Um. Now, um, in terms of your uh, your kind of social situation. Um, are you working at the moment?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] <UNIN/>, what do you work as?[doctor] You're a <UNIN/>, a, a medical doctor?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. Uh, which, specialty are you in?[patient] Yep.[doctor] Plastic surgery, OK, great. And, um, do you, have any, um, allergies to any medication at all?[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. And, um, are you, um, living alone?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Right, OK. Um, fantastic. Uh <UNIN/>, do you smoke at all?[doctor] Right, OK. Um, that's fine. Now, obviously you're a, you're a medic yourself. Did you have any thoughts as to what might be going on?[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Right, OK. Um, well the, the way you're describing these episodes. They make me concerned about, mini-strokes or TIAs, <UNIN/>, transient ischemic attacks. Um.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] And so, that's something quite urgent. And given that you've got a family history of um, stroke.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Um, even though you're quite young, I think um, it's something that we need to exclude. So, what I'm probably going to do, uh, in fact what I am going to do, is I'm going to, refer you to a stroke, a TIA clinic.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Um, now just to double-check. Do you have the symptoms right now?[doctor] OK. So, so, what I'm gonna do, is I'm uh, I'm gonna refer you to a, a mini-stroke clinic, or a TIA clinic.[doctor] Um, I send that referral off now, and then you can attend them, they, they'll usually, call you in within the next one to two days, OK.[doctor] Because it's something relatively urgent. Now, today it's Wednesday, so we've got a few days <UNIN/>, before the weekend. So, um, uh, basically the deadline should be, Thursday, Friday.[doctor] We're expecting you to be seen by the time, that's the kind of turnaround we're, we're looking at.[doctor] And in that clinic, they'll be doing a number of things. Um, they'll be checking, they'll be doing a ultrasound of the, carotid arteries, like your, your father had. Um, and, they'll be doing a, maybe a, they might do a scan of your brain as well, to check if there's any signs of a bleed there.[doctor] But, um, they'll be doing a range of tests in a short time frame, in order to exclude whether, you have um, any illness. OK, whether you have got any kind of stroke or, mini-stroke.[doctor] Now, if your symptoms return and they persist, they're prolonged. Then um, you may need to attend A and E.[doctor] OK, because um, our presumptive, working diagnosis is, mini-stroke or TIA, OK.[doctor] And if, a mini-stroke is prolonged then uh, then we end up thinking that this might be a stroke and in that case, that becomes even more of an emergency. So, we're not talking about waiting one or two days, we want you to go to hospital in that instance, as soon as possible, OK.[doctor] Now if <UNIN/>, things happen again, feel free to contact us, we can assess you over the phone, we can give you direction and guidance over the phone. That's, that's, that's not a problem, you know, you, you've got easy access to us.[doctor] OK. So, um, this is the plan going forward. Um, I'm going to, um, do that referral.[doctor] You should hear back from the hospital, relatively soon.[doctor] The hospital, you can actually ring them, on um, uh, the PALS number, and then there's also the TIA clinic number.[doctor] I'm going to leave that number in the notes for this consultation, OK. So you'll have all the information you need, to chase this appointment.[doctor] And um, if you want, you can ring them, either today or tomorrow morning.[doctor] <UNIN/>, today in the afternoon, wait uh, one or two hours. Or tomorrow morning just to find out when they got time to slot you in. And, just to make sure they've got you in the system, that they've got in the books, and they're going to be calling you in, OK.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, this isn't, a, an immediate emergency that you need to rush down to A and E. But it's something quite urgent we need to, deal with in a short space of time, OK.[doctor] So if there's, if there's any delay that, transpires for example, you can't make the appointment or, you know, they, you don't get called. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, you, you get, get in contact back, back with us, OK.[doctor] All right. Did you have any questions at all?[doctor] OK, great. So just bear with me a few minutes, and then I'll send that uh, all through and then you should, um, you should be able to help, you should have the information at your hands to, in order to take things further, OK.[doctor] All the best. Take care now. Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

primock_/day2_consultation10,"[doctor] Hello. Good afternoon.[patient] Hello, how are you?[doctor] Hi there. This is Doctor <UNIN/>, from GP at Hand.[doctor] Hi Anthony. So, could I have your um, before we start, could I have your full name and date of birth? If that's possible?[patient] Oh hey, um, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities.[doctor] That's <UNIN/>, thank you for that. Are you in a private place where you're OK to speak?[doctor] OK, great. So how can I help you today?[patient] Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, uh and like some pain in my, like, lower stomach?[doctor] Sure, OK. And, um, uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, did the, did the pain wake you up?[patient] Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah.[doctor] What, what time did it wake you up?[patient] No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.[doctor] And, what time do you normally get up?[patient] Yep.[doctor] Is the headache still present now?[patient] So <UNIN/> in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.[doctor] OK. Have you had this kind of pain before?[patient] Uh, on the left side.[doctor] So they were less severe. Were they similar in nature in terms of being one-sided and the type of pain?[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[doctor] OK, all right. And, um, can I just double-check, do you have any neck stiffness at all?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. And do you have any fever?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] All right. Um, how are you with bright lights at the moment? Do you feel sensitive to bright lights or can you, can you tolerate them all right, OK?[doctor] OK. And, can I just double-check, um, are you feeling nauseous at all?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] OK. Um, and um, can I just double-check, does anyone in your family have any migraines or anything like that? They've been diagnosed with migraines?[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] OK. Um, and um, are you under any particular stress at the moment?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] Right, OK. Um, and, um, how long has that been the case for?[doctor] <UNIN/>, how would you say your mood is?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK. Do you have, have you ever been <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> diagnosed with anxiety, or depression or stress in the past?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] OK. Are you taking Sertraline at the moment?[doctor] OK. Um, and how do you feel in terms of <UNIN/>, anxiety at the moment? Do you feel anxious at the moment?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK, all right. Um, now, sorry to ask this, just need to ask this for <UNIN/>, anyone suffering from anxiety. Do you have any <UNIN/>, have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or hurting yourself?[doctor] Good, I'm glad to hear that. Um, now, with regards to this headache. Is it worse when you lie down, or um, is, is, is it better when you lie down?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[patient] No.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Um, so, would you say ultimately, it's better when you lie down? Or have you not <UNIN/>?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] OK. Um, and um, in terms of um, this, headache since this morning, have you taken anything for it yet?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Has that helped?[doctor] OK. Taking anything else at all?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] OK. Um, do you have any other illnesses at all?[doctor] Have you ever been diagnosed with high blood pressure?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Have you ever had your blood pressure checked?[doctor] OK. Um, and are there any illnesses in your family?[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, all right. And um, are you on any medication?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Do you have any allergies to any medication?[doctor] All right. And, are you living by yourself at the moment, or living with someone else?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Are you a smoker?[doctor] OK. And, uh, do you have any pets at home?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. And, can I just double-check, how much exercise would you do normally a week?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[doctor] And what's your diet like?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] All right. Um, now um, in terms of this headache, uh, obviously I haven't been able to examine you, or see you directly.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] But, um, it sounds like it might be one of two things. It could be an element of what we call tension headache.[doctor] OK. That's one possibility. Um, and what makes that, more likely is the fact that, you've been under some pressure, and you have a history of anxiety in the past, OK. Um.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] The other possibility is, um, migraine as well.[doctor] OK. Um, and, the fact, what makes that more likely is the fact that it's on one side, and that you've got some sensitivity to light.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK, So, what, what I think we can do, is um, I think we can give you some, um, generic, pain relief.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] That would be the appropriate first step, for, migraine type headaches. OK. So I'll tell you what it is in a second.[doctor] And the other thing that I was gonna suggest is, we maybe look, explore things to try and decrease the stress from work.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] So, um, the medication-wise, the things that we'd start off first line, if someone had migraine was to, would be to start Ibuprofen.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] And um, uh, that, the doses of Ibuprofen can be a bit, more than the normal doses Ibuprofen so that's one thing we can start. You can keep on taking Paracetamol as well if you like, but the, the Ibuprofen's um, actually more effective <UNIN/>, for migraine.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] And, um, yeah, so the, the guidelines have changed, recently we used, we, before that we used to give Paracetamol as first line but now it's, um, Ibuprofen or Aspirin.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] That's, <UNIN/> thing. Um, the other thing I'd like you to do, is maybe consider taking some time off work. OK, because if the headache is due to stress from work.[doctor] Um, maybe having a week off if you self-certify, that might help with things. And I'd also like you to explore, counselling options as well so there's, a counselling service in your area, that I can give you the link for, for you to self-refer.[doctor] I'd like you to, <UNIN/>, OK I'd like you to try that. Um, what, we're gonna do is, we'll have a follow-up in a week's time.[doctor] As well as those two things, other things I'd like you to do, is to try and ensure that you're having a minimum of seven, eight hours sleep at night, every night. And you're drinking a minimum of, um, one point five to two litres uh, of water or fluids a day, and that's not including coffee or tea.[doctor] All right, because sometimes dehydration and you know uh, fatigue can be causes of headaches as well. Um.[doctor] Yeah, so it, that, that, that is um, you know, we need to rule those things out. Um, let's, let's try that.[doctor] OK. Um, and let's have a follow-up appointment, if we're finding that things are not getting better, we might need to arrange some blood tests or um, look at uh, other possibilities, but, we'll try that in the first instance.[doctor] Um, if anything changes in the meantime, or you get worried or things get worse. Feel free, have a lower threshold for ringing us back and we can book you an appointment, and we can reassess the situation.[doctor] OK, no problem. So there'll be a summary of all of this in the notes. Um, and I'll also leave a link, to some of the danger signs of symptoms of headaches, in the notes. If you can read through that in your own time, that will just help you to have a bit more, control over what's going on and understanding of what, what, what kind of things, should trigger you contacting another doctor.[doctor] No problem, OK. So we'll, we'll touch base in a week's time, with me or, myself or one of the other doctors, and we <UNIN/>, we'll take it from there, OK.[doctor] Brilliant, OK then, all right. Take care then, all the best.[doctor] Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

Regular medication?[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] Methotrexate. OK. <UNIN/>, what are you on that for?[doctor] SLE, OK. Do you have any other <UNIN/>, diagnoses? Any other illnesses at all?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Right, OK. Um, and do you have any allergies to any medication?[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Any other allergies at all?[doctor] OK. So, um, you're on, you're taking Methotrexate at the moment. When was the last time you had Methotrexate?[doctor] Ohh, you had it this morning. OK, ohh right, all right.[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] OK. Um <UNIN/>, um, couple of things I'd like to do in order to try and um, get an idea of how, unwell you are.[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] OK. Um, the first thing I'd like to do, is to try and measure your pulse.[doctor] So, what, the way we're gonna do this, is that, if you're, if I can get you to try and locate the pulse in your wrist.[doctor] <UNIN/>. Not everyone can do this, so don't worry if you can't.[doctor] But if you, if you can tell me whether you can feel the regular pulse. It's just under the thumb. If you put two fingers up and down like that, you might be able to feel the pulse.[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] You got it, OK. Are you sure?[doctor] All right. So what I'm going to do, is I'm going to tell you when to start counting, and when to stop counting OK. So I'll just get my stopwatch up.[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK. So if you can, um, you've still got the pulse?[patient] No.[doctor] OK. So if you can start counting, now please.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] If you can stop now, <UNIN/>. That, I think that was about eleven or twelve. Um, so that would make your heart rate about, sixty six to seventy four, that's, that's OK, good.[doctor] Fantastic. And the next thing I'd like you to try and do, OK. Um, it depends on the lighting, so it may not be possible.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] But the next thing I'd like you to try and do is just, to get you to squeeze the tip of your finger.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] And then let me see how quickly the redness come back. OK, so if you can see what I'm doing now. My finger's come, right behind the screen, I'm squeezing it, OK. <UNIN/>, just watch me first, it's all right, just watch me first. Yeah, I'm, I'm squeezing it.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] And then you can see, that, it goes, pale and then it goes back to the normal red colour, OK.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[doctor] So if I can get you just to put your finger up to the, your camera. And then with the other hand, just try and squeeze it, and see<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, perfect, that's great. Thank you so much.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] The last thing I'd like to do, is I'd like <UNIN/>, to <UNIN/>, try and have a look down your throat.[doctor] OK. Are, are you doing this consultation via, um, a phone or a <UNIN/>, laptop?[doctor] A phone?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <UNIN/>, sorry, say that again.[patient] Okay.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK, <UNIN/>, OK. So if you, if you, um, position your device up above your head, put your head back, mouth open wide, and let me see if I can have a <UNIN/>. That's, fantastic. And say ah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Perfect. Thank you for that. Excellent.[doctor] OK. Last thing, is if I can get you to feel inside your neck. Just on the sides here, OK, um, by your Adam's apple. Tell me whether you can feel any enlarged glands or not.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] All right. Um.[doctor] Now, um, uh, <UNIN/>. Sorry, I've forgotten your name.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Doris, OK Doris. Um, so, so Doris, um, what, what I think we need to do, is um. This sounds like you might have a chest infection.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. If you're coughing up blood, and you're feeling your heart racing. Um.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Uh, I think, you need to be examined today, someone needs to listen to your chest.[doctor] And, um, maybe check your blood pressure as well, check that, you're stable. I have to say examining you now, from what limited, examination I could do online.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] You're, everything does seem to be OK, in terms of, you, you don't seem acutely unstable.[doctor] However, if you've got, this kind of pain, um, when taking a deep breath in and you're coughing up blood. We do, do, we do need to assess you to figure out whether you have a Pneumonia or chest infection.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] And um, that would involve someone listening to your chest with a stethoscope, and you may need um, an antibiotic. Uh, there's one thing I need to ask you. Have you been, on any long-haul flight recently?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] No, OK. Have you ever had any clots in your legs, or clots in your lung? Blood clots?[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] No, OK. Anyone in the family have that?[doctor] No, OK. All right. Um, what I think we'll do is um, we'll arrange for you to get reviewed in a clinic today.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK. Um, I would like someone to listen to your chest, and check your blood pressure.[doctor] And to, to recheck your pulse as well. Just make sure, and check your temperature, make sure all those parameters are OK.[doctor] You may well need an antibiotic, OK. Um, do you have any allergies to any antibiotics?[doctor] No, OK. Um, I, I'm not, I'm gonna, not, I'm not going to prescribe anything for you now, because I think you need to have that, basic assessment first.[doctor] Um, before we proceed to the next step. But the, that's what I would predict the next step might be. Um, I'm going to leave the number in the notes for this appointment, for you to ring our support team.[doctor] And then, they will, book you in for a face-to-face appointment with one of our GPs today.[doctor] And then, they'll do that assessment, and then we'll take it from there, OK.[doctor] Um, uh, given the, the way in which you uh, have presented now. Just one day, with a fever and, this slight pain, <UNIN/>, concurrent with the, the blood in the, the, the flem.[doctor] That's not usually how lung cancer is presented. It's more insidious, over a longer period of time, with other symptoms.[doctor] Um, however, we might need to get some investigations to exclude that. It depends on the examination finding, when we see you.[doctor] All right. <UNIN/>, are you worried about lung cancer?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Sure, of course yeah. So, just remind me how old you are again. I'm sorry.[doctor] Forty five, OK. It's something we do need to be cognisant of, OK. Um, and, we may end up having to do a follow-up chest X-ray, if things don't settle down. But at the moment, it, it seems more like a chest infection, rather than a lung cancer.[doctor] Yeah, that, that is good to know, yeah, so that's, 'cause that's easier to treat. But we still need to make sure that things are OK because, chest infections can become nasty as well.[doctor] It can lead to infection inside the body, <UNIN/>, we want to avoid that as well. So, let's get you checked out today, and hopefully we can put your mind to rest, and get you on the right course of treatment.[doctor] All right, you're welcome. All right, take care then.

That must be very difficult for you. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> quite lethargic and weak, you mentioned. Um, OK. And um, April are you normally otherwise fit and well?[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days.

Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK. And what do you take for your blood pressure? Any, or what what medications do you take on a regular basis, if you don't mind saying?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah.

Regarding any family history, is there anything I should be aware of?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, alright. Who's looking after your diabetes?

How much do you drink on those nights?[doctor] OK. So um, yeah so you're probably just about under the limit of um, the recommended limit.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Something <UNIN/> think about, just in terms of your blood pressure and diabetes, maybe something that you can maybe cut down on if you can.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> really ideally, the the the right answer is to cut down completely. But so in practice I know that's not realistic. So maybe for the first few weeks, why don't you cut down to two glasses a week. And then, one week thereafter[doctor] Um and if you are coping OK, then you can maybe try and cut down altogether.[doctor] OK? Just something for you to think about. Um, right so uh just <UNIN/> as we wrap up really, um April I think based on your story, I think uh essentially I think you're, you're going through a bit of a bit of a viral illness. Um, I don't think there's anything to worry about.[doctor] You know you've had a bit of a cough, bit of a runny nose, feeling quite weak and lethargic.[doctor] I'm hoping that, you know, you're probably over the worst of it now. It's been five days. I'm hoping you're maybe going to get better in the next couple of days. It normally lasts for about a week to ten days.[doctor] Yeah, absolutely. So, you know things you can do to help yourself in the meantime is to, you know get some nice, good rest.[doctor] Drink plenty of fluids. Keep yourself well-hydrated. You can take regular Paracetamol.[doctor] If you feel like you're still not getting any better in two to three days, it's probably worth coming back to see me again. We can check you over.[doctor] And if you are still feeling feverish, um and your cough isn't getting any better, then we may look to give you some antibiotics for your chest. <UNIN/> some of the uh uh common source of infection. Um[doctor] Yeah so I think you know <UNIN/>, really I think it depends on you. <UNIN/> it's um if you are coughing, then there is a theoretical, you know risk that you're maybe slightly infectious still. So I would say maybe take a day or two off work, if you can.[doctor] Uh and get some good bed rest. Um and maybe think about work early next week.[doctor] But um, if your cough isn't getting any better, or your breathing is getting worse, I want you to come back and see me sooner. OK?[doctor] No no no <UNIN/>, nothing to worry about otherwise.[doctor] OK. Well, have a good day. Appreciate it.","S (Subjective):

Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK. That's OK. So um, normally at this stage I like to examine you. Um[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] To see the rash itself, to see exactly what type of rash it is. But from what you've told me, you mentioned it's, you've got some dry skin and some, uh cracked skin as well.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Uh and has been very itchy. And so would your um[doctor] Uh your your background of eczema. Um[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] So[doctor] Sorry to say, there's a couple of questions I wanted to ask you, which I completely forgot, my apologies. Um, apart from the eczema, do you have any other medical problems I should be aware of?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Not anymore, OK. And do you take any regular medications at the moment?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] No, OK. Do you have any allergies to anything?[doctor] <UNIN/> sorry I said do you have any allergies to anything?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Hello?[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/> can you hear me? That's alright I think it <UNIN/>. Uh do you have any allergies at all?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] No, OK. Um and tell me about your um uh your situation at home. Who do you live with?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. And what do you do for work?[patient] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. Uh no no no that's <UNIN/>, that's absolutely fine. Um just a couple of questions I want to ask you, which can sometimes affect your symptoms, is, do you smoke at all?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] No. And do you drink much in the way of alcohol?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. OK. OK I've got to say, at this stage I've got to say <UNIN/> this sound quality is not uh great. But I will continue because we've come this far. Um[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] So um, based on everything you mentioned Sarah , <UNIN/> I do wonder whether this is a flare-up of your eczema. Um[patient] Yep.[doctor] The reason being that you said it was quite itchy. Um it's mainly affecting your chest and your back.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] Um and uh, having looked at your skin, uh the the the rash does appear quite familiar. Um you mentioned <UNIN/> using steroid creams, yesterday.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Um from the pharmacy. I wonder whether giving you a stronger prescription of a <UNIN/> of a steroid may be beneficial.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Uh, which I'm happy to prescribe to you today. As well as, I'm going to give you something, some emollients, which helps to moisturize the skin.[doctor] Um which <UNIN/> use in the bath and shower. And it's definitely worth um using that for the first seven to ten days.[doctor] Uh before we make the decision on whether it's working or not.[doctor] Um it's also worth um using antihistamines, which you can sometimes buy over counter.[doctor] Things like Loratadine or Piriton, which can help the itchiness of your skin.[doctor] And uh, um it's also worth keeping a diary of any triggers which are affecting your symptoms, anything you wear or anything you use, in terms of shower gels or soap.[doctor] Because if that's causing your symptoms, then we need to have a discussion about an eczema CU.[doctor] Ohh, could you say that again, sorry?[doctor] OK.[doctor] <UNIN/> OK. So it's something for you to think about. <UNIN/> you can get different types of antihistamines. I can give you something a little bit stronger today as well.[doctor] Um, something like Fexofenadine, which I can give to you today. It's definitely worth trying, and it's not going to do you any harm.[doctor] Um but I <UNIN/> think using the steroids and the emollients, um on a regular basis[doctor] Uh over the next week to ten days, should hopefully <UNIN/> control your symptoms. But do come back and see me next week, if things don't get better.[doctor] OK? Um do you have any questions for me?[doctor] OK. Well I wish you all the best.[doctor] Thank you.

Is, I'd like to have a look inside your mouth, OK.[doctor] Um, one of the things that, um, we'd be worried about if, someone's going to have an acute allergic reaction. Is to see whether there's any swelling, of the lips, or the tissues inside the mouth, or the.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Soft tissues of the airway. And, um, I can, I've got a fairly good view of your lips, but I'd like maybe if you can, bring your device closer to your mouth, and then put your head back, mouth open wide. Sit somewhere where there's good lighting. And I just wanna have a look inside the throat, if that's OK?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Perfect, OK, great. Now, um, um, can, can I just get you to do it again? And, just say ah, this time.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, fantastic, brilliant. OK. Um.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Uh, John. Based on, um, how you look. How you're talking to me, and how you're breathing, and the appearance, and your wrist.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Um, I don't feel that you're having <UNIN/>, a, an, an, a life-threatening, uh, allergic reaction.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Now it's very normal, to have, a rash, when you have some kind of insect bite. It's uh, it's a localised, um, uh, inflammatory reaction, that um, is normal and that <UNIN/>, immediate reaction, that redness, and that maybe slight swelling, is usually temporary.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] What we're worried about, is when someone has, um, compromise of their breathing. So you mentioned, breathing difficulties and you mentioned swelling of your lip. Thankfully I can't see any of that right now.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/>, but that's, the most, urgent and most pressing thing that we'd be watching out for.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Given that it hasn't happened, initially, it's unlikely to happen later. OK we, so we have like a <UNIN/>, stage one and stage two reaction, for these types of bites.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] And, usually if you're gonna have the reaction, it will happen straight away.[patient] Yep.[doctor] So, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, we may be coming out of the danger zone now, it's um. But I'm just going to warn you about what those signs and symptoms are, in case it happens. So for example.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] You would have, swelling of the lips, difficulty breathing. You might have something called stridor, which is an inspiratory sound that you, when you're trying, trying to breathe. It makes like a rasping sound, like this. OK. <UNIN/>.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Thankfully, you don't have anything like that right now. It seems to me like this is a localised allergic reaction.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] However, if anything changes, if anything deteriorates. Either make an appointment with us, or go straight to A and E.[doctor] Um, uh, and in some cases, if it's, if it's, uh, progressing rapidly, it's better to go straight to A and E, rather than to, wait for a booked appointment with us, OK.[doctor] What I'd like you to do now, is I'd like you to try and take some antihistamines.[doctor] So you can buy them over the counter. You can get Piriton or Chlorphenamine, and you can take one tablet, four milligrams, um, up to about six times a day. OK.[doctor] Or you can just take a one-a-day one, whichever is your preference, that's, that's absolutely fine, there's no, no issue. That should be enough to control this.[doctor] Um, if, the redness in your arm spreads, and you, it feels hot, or you, you know, you have signs of any localised infection.[doctor] We may need to think about other treatments, like an antibiotic.[doctor] And like I said if anything deteriorates, in terms of your breathing, that's urgent and we need to process that, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, action needs to be taken urgently.[doctor] Did you have any other, um, queries or was there anything else that you're worried about?[doctor] Yeah, that's, that's over the, yeah <UNIN/>, over the counter. You don't need to, any chemist, will have it, you don't need a prescription for that. Yeah, it's probably cheaper to buy it over the counter actually, than to get it via prescription.[doctor] OK. Um, now, um, uh, on the basis of what you've told me, I don't think you need any allergy testing. I think this is just a <UNIN/>, a straightforward localised reaction to a, an insect bite.[doctor] However, if it was to happen that, you know, this, you're, you're having these kind of reactions on a regular basis or other, <UNIN/>, non-specific rashes. We might need to think about blood testing, I don't think we're at, at that moment yet. OK.[doctor] So uh, but <UNIN/>, that's something to bear in mind in case this, becomes a recurrent pattern.[doctor] OK then, so, we'll leave it like that for now, OK. I'm gonna leave a link to some information about anaphylactic reactions, just for you to read about it. I don't want you to panic, but just for you to be aware what <UNIN/> symptoms are.[doctor] If those kind of things happen, get back to us.[doctor] If you're feeling worried, just have a lower threshold for <UNIN/>, having a chat with us, sometimes a chat is all you need to calm things down.[doctor] All right then John, OK. Uh, well we'll leave it like that, <UNIN/>, come back to us if you have any further issues.[doctor] My pleasure. All right, take care then. All the best.[doctor] Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] So So you would say this in mind weakness, mind. <UNIN/> So <UNIN/> just to <UNIN/> get my facts right. So you would say it's definitely weakness rather than because of the pain, you can't hold it. That's two different things. So you know sometimes you can't hold it because it's hurting you <UNIN/>.[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[patient] No.[doctor] OK. <UNIN/> Fine. So, you're definitely having some sort some form of weakness, OK. Edward, any neck pain at all?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> neck pain and all? OK, right, OK. So, just a bit more of a background because I don't have much information on the system. Um, do you have any past, uh,  medical history that you'd like to share?[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days.

And your weakness is only in your left arm. Legs are walking and all this, normal, yeah?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] You mentioned for a while you couldn't see, you know, the outside peripheral vision from your left eye. How long did that episode last for?[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah.

No, OK, that's fine.[doctor] OK, so, right. So after, you know, speaking and examining, you know, yourself, I think it's quite important that we do investigate it a bit further. I'm just wondering whether there's something a bit more than just the boxing here.[doctor] OK, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> few things that's, made me think other than, just like a boxing injury, is for instance, um, you know, when you said you can't, your vision went, your peripheral vision was not there for about twenty. So, and that with the weakness of the arms, make me think, is there something else going on rather than just an injury?[doctor] <UNIN/> sometimes you know you do get things like MS, multiple sclerosis. So  people with multiple sclerosis can have, um, visual problems, like what you've experienced and sometimes <UNIN/> you know the odd numbness tingling sensations going on. OK?[doctor] We, if we capture it a bit early there are treatments for it. OK? I'm not, obviously I'm not suggesting that you do have it, but it is quite important to find out that, whether you have it or not that's the most serious kind of thing that needs to be, uh, dealt with here.[doctor] Yeah. So, what we can do is I'm going to do an urgent, very urgent neurology referral. Yeah? What they, what that might entail is the brain scan and things like that. Hello?[doctor] <UNIN/> I know this might sound a bit of a shock to you, um, but <UNIN/> I'm, I think it is more important that we investigate this a bit more seriously.[doctor] OK. Any questions at all?[doctor] No, that's something  we can't do.  The treatment for it is actually some steroids and things like that, uh,  when you have an acute <UNIN/> you know, acute reaction or things like that. But, saying that, first we need to  <UNIN/> firm diagnosis.[doctor] Yeah. <UNIN/> While you're waiting for this to be done, if there's any weakness, uh, you know, if the weakness progresses to your legs, or there's any kind of headaches, vomiting, fits, and your visual symptoms are getting worse and not getting better, then that would be an A and E.[doctor] Alright.[doctor] Yeah. I'm <UNIN/> I'm sorry. I, I do appreciate you are a bit worried, but, you know, it's good that we know that you've come and spoken to us today, and hopefully we'll get things sorted and the ball rolling.

I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] Oh dear, I'm sorry to hear that. I can, I can understand why it's affecting you. Um[doctor] But <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> why don't we, why don't we take a good history first, and let me examine you. And then we can have a little chat afterwards, and see what's going on here.[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] Um so you mentioned a few things. You mentioned a headache. You also mentioned some disease, like Lyme's, uh before the headaches came on.[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] And your vision has been blurry as well. Is that right?

And what happened then?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] How long did it last for?[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Did you do anything that made it better?[doctor] Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] Yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Yeah. Yeah. <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Yeah, sure. I mean I can see your concern obviously is a lot, there's a lot of worry there.[doctor] Um but you know let let let, as I said let's take it step by step, um to see exactly what the cause of these headaches are first. Um, I'm just going to ask you some, um very uh yes no questions if that's OK, ma'am. Um[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Um have you noticed any problems with your speech at all, any difficulties with your words?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Any problems with your arms and legs? For example numbness or weakness?[doctor] Any difficulty with balance, your balance or coordination?[patient] No.[doctor] OK. And have you had any injuries to your head? Have you had a fall recently, or been knocked on the head?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] OK, alright. Um and and you're feeling otherwise OK. So, for example your um[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Uh your your breathing's OK? You're not feeling breathless, or[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] No, OK. Um do you have any other medical history I should be aware of?[doctor] No. So for example, have you had, has anyone told you you've had migraines in the past?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] No, OK. Do you <UNIN/>[doctor] OK.[doctor] Right, <UNIN/> my next question was that of family history. Is there anything in the family? So apart from migraines, is there anything else? Is there anything related to brain, for example?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] What was that, sorry?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> thyroid  as well. OK. Um OK any other problems with for example, the brain, or? Um you mentioned brain cancer. Any other family history of <UNIN/>?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] No, OK. Um in terms of medications, do you take anything on a regular basis?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. And how long have you been on that for?[doctor] Three months, OK. And is that mainly for contraception, or is that for something else?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, alright.[doctor] That's something you meant to have a little discussion about today as well. Um[patient] Okay.[doctor] Uh well my next question was about um your social, your situation at home. You mentioned you work in the fashion industry.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And your work, is your job quite stressful at the moment?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Have you been[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/>. Is it getting you down?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, alright. And what kind of things do you do to alleviate your stress, normally?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK. Do you do much in the way of exercise?[doctor] No, OK. Um who's at home with you?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. Um are you coping OK at the moment?[doctor] Yeah? OK. Um do you smoke at all? <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> and do you drink much in the way of alcohol?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK, alright. Um, so normally at this <UNIN/> I'd like to kind of proceed to examination. Um[patient] Okay.[doctor] That's um <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> based on your story, um I wonder whether you may, uh may have a migraine, uh <UNIN/> migraine type headache. Uh it sounds[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, very classical of that, of that nature, the the the <UNIN/> headache on one side, throbbing nature, the nausea, vomiting, um sensitivity to bright lights.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Uh, I'm reassured that you don't have anything more serious, such as meningitis, or indeed[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Brain cancer, I know that was a big worry of yours initially. Um[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] <UNIN/> yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Well, I hope that puts your, you know, <UNIN/> mind at ease. Um, certainly this is the second migraine you've had in the space of a month. Um,[doctor] So I think, moving forwards, there's a couple of options. I think keeping a headache diary would be quite important, uh to see exactly what's triggering these headaches.[doctor] And in terms of trying to treat your headaches today, some strong painkillers would be advisable. So, <UNIN/> think about Paracetamol, or even Co-codamol.[doctor] Um, and some anti-inflammatories, such as Ibuprofen and Naproxen. How's that sound to you?[doctor] Um and uh, you know if your headaches were to become more persistent, then we could maybe think about giving you some medications that will stop your headaches from happening in the first place, something <UNIN/> prophylactic medicines.[doctor] <UNIN/> then we could have a discussion next time I see you next week, perhaps.[doctor] OK. Um, now a couple of things I want you to think about is, you know if your symptoms aren't getting better next two three days, or indeed they're getting worse.[doctor] I'd like you to come back and see me, um straight away if possible. So if your headache's getting worse, not responding to medications[doctor] Or your um neck pain is getting worse, or you develop any weakness in your arms and legs, or your vision, then I want you to come back and see me straight away. OK?[doctor] Does that sound <UNIN/> all OK?[doctor] Great. Any questions for me?[doctor] OK. Have a good day![doctor] Right.","S (Subjective):

You're walking fine.[doctor] Um, and, and you've taken paracetamol and it hasn't helped. Is that all? OK.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] So, it sounds like what you're suffering from is what's known as a migraine.

Bye.[doctor] Um, and sometimes they can present, you know, even postmenopausally.[doctor] So, there's different, there's different ways you can get migraines. Uh, and the reason why this sounds like migraines is because it's on one side of the head.[doctor] <UNIN/> typical of a migraine, you've got blurry vision, again which is very typical, with the nausea and vomiting, that's also typical of a migraine.[doctor] Now, um, uh, <UNIN/> obviously, if the <UNIN/> headache is really severe, and I'll suggest some medications you can try, if that doesn't work, we would want to see you, um, as soon as possible, to do like a full neurological exam as well.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> to make sure that, you know, there's, you know, when we do a more specific examination that, um, everything all seems fine.[doctor] Um, I <UNIN/> I would recommend in the time between now and when we can see you, uh, if you take some medications, maybe something like ibuprofen?[doctor] So, yes, a migraine, yeah, no, you know, even sooner than that, we can look at maybe half an hour to forty minutes, depending on what your response to it is, for some people,[doctor] Uh, whatever medications they take the migraine doesn't improve, um, and they can last from anywhere from four hours to seventy two hours, migraines can last. Um, but <UNIN/>.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] No. So, what, there's lots of medication treatments so, there's, it can be ibuprofen with an anti-sickness, um, so and <UNIN/>, which you can get from the pharmacy.[doctor] Um, and you also to drink, uh, sugary and carbonated drinks, something like Coke.[doctor] For the three of them is, uh, is a good sort of cocktail to start them, then we can go up the treatment ladder, you can get specific migraine relief medication.[doctor] And that should be something to try between now and when we see you to do the, um, to do the assessment.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> assessment to where we can see you today at some point.[doctor] And, but however, if you do take these medications and, you know, by the time your appointment time comes in and you feel much better in yourself, you can cancel it, um, you can give us a call and cancel it.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Uh, any, any questions for me?[doctor] All right.

Did you have any other symptoms? Any chest pain, temperature, cold symptoms, anything like that?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods.

Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Have you been able to do any exercise?[doctor] OK, and do you have a peak flow meter at home, where you measure your breathing?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] You have what's called a peak flow meter, which you breathe into to get a score on your breathing?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] And do you normally take any asthma inhalers over the last few years?[doctor] You do? So you said you stopped them three to four years ago?[doctor] OK. How about over the last three to four years?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Have you taken any medication?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK, so you, you normally take that do you? Or is that just recently?[doctor] OK, and how often do you normally need it?[patient] No.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] OK. What about when you exercise normally, do you have to use medication? Uh, inhalers?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days.

Or just when you walk?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Are you able to get <UNIN/> up and down the stairs OK?[doctor] Right, OK. Um, and did you say you were finding it hard to complete your sentences?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK, um.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Right, OK. Um, I mean, it sounds like you've had a flare up of your asthma. It could be, um, triggered by, if there's more pollen around, or there may be, you may have a viral infection, causing it to get worse.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Did you say you checked your temperature already?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Was it normal?[doctor] <UNIN/> What was your temperature?[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] OK, that's fine. Um, have you got an asthma inhaler at home?[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. So what I would suggest is you take it more regularly than you are doing at the moment. Have you got, um, a spacer at home?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Um, do you have a spacer at home?[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK. Um, what I can do is, I can prescribe you a peak flow meter so we can check your breathing level and a spacer to use your inhaler a bit more efficiently, which the pharmacist can show you how you use that when you pick it up.[doctor] Um, and if you increase it so you're taking it two to four puffs, like, every four hours?[doctor] Initially, um, if you get a high temperature or your wheezing is getting worse, you need to call us back straightaway so we can just advise you further with that.[doctor] And it will be a good idea when you're feeling better if we can arrange just a review, just to see how your asthma is, because we may need to start some other medication for you.[doctor] You could arrange a review in a week or so, um, but, but before that and if you're, if you're feeling worse.[doctor] OK, and the other thing to do would be to take a regular antihistamine.[doctor] Which you can get from the pharmacy, I can put a <UNIN/> on your notes about what to take.[doctor] And then if you, when you get the peak flow meter, if you can take, the pharmacist can show you how to use it, and if you can record a value first thing when you wake up.[doctor] And in the evening over the next week, and then we can discuss that over the phone when we look at the figures and see whether you need to go on another inhaler as well.[doctor] Have you got any questions?[doctor] Thanks a lot, bye.","S (Subjective):

And just because of your symptoms, which have been ongoing for six weeks, that's obviously quite a long time to notice a change in your energy levels.[doctor] Um, I think it's important to get some blood tests, checking all the normal things, like liver, kidneys, blood count, etc. But also, some more specific things like, um, a bacterial infection you can sometimes get, uh, including one which you can get which can produce a rash like that. So, that would involve blood tests. Are you happy to do that?[doctor] Well, you can get, uh, you can get a bacterial infection caused which is called, um, it's called lyme disease that you can get a rash like that from a tick bite.[doctor] So that's something we would do a test for, as well. Um, and if that comes back positive, then there are specific antibiotics that we would give you to treat it.[doctor] So it's definitely worth checking for, but we would also check just for <UNIN/> which can cause reduced energy, tiredness and aching for, persistent over six weeks.[doctor] So if you're happy to do that, if you book that through the support line, and then when you've had the test arrange a follow up about a week after, after you've had the test done.[doctor] Um, yeah, we can do that over the phone to start with.[doctor] OK?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Any other questions?[doctor] OK, that's great.

Um.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] That you may have. So, <UNIN/>, um, no sort of significant weight loss? Um, or unexplained weight loss? Any <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>?[doctor] You've been losing your appetite recently?[doctor] And you're a little bit concerned about that? But you haven't, you haven't lost any weight, that you think of?[doctor] And any, um, sort of rashes or anything? Or, uh, <UNIN/>, and you.[doctor] Not that, not that you can think of. OK.[doctor] Um. So, I would ask to examine you now, but um, I, I don't know if I could sort of look inside your throat, at least. To see if there's a, probably, there's.[doctor] Ohh no, well, no, it's OK, I <UNIN/>, might think about doing a. Have you got any lumps or bumps around your neck? That you can feel?[doctor] No that you, no, OK.[doctor] Um. And, so finally, you, you were talking about, uh, <UNIN/>. I mean, it sounds to me that, um, you've been a little bit up and down. Sore throat. Developed a dry cough.[doctor] Um, you are slightly short of breath, but not too overly concerningly short of breath. What I would say, we're just coming to the end of consultation now, <UNIN/>. If you feel significantly worse .[doctor] Um. Uh, if you get more short of breath, or sudden change in your breathlessness. Um, or breathlessness that you are concerned about. Then I would advise you to see, no <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, go and see a GP. Um, and actually see somebody physically.[doctor] Um, uh, but I think, for now I can sort of, uh, try and reassure you that, um, if this clears up, as I expect it would.

I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] OK.[doctor] That's <UNIN/>.[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] And apart from asthma, do you have anything else?[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] Yep.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] OK?[doctor] OK. So, you've, you've had the diarrhoea for <UNIN/> three days, and now you're having <UNIN/> pain and vomiting.[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] Was the diarrhoea been getting better or worse?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] OK.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. And how often do you go to the toilet?[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] That must be, that must be hard.[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Have you had to drink more water than normal?[doctor] An important question, have you noticed any blood?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] And you mentioned tummy pain, can you tell me more about your tummy pain, like where it is, and if it goes anywhere?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Yep.[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] OK. You've been able to eat and drink?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Hmm. And you said the tummy pain's in the middle of your tummy. Does it go anywhere else?[patient] No.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. And when was the last time you vomited?[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Did you have any breakfast?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK. And <UNIN/>, and you vomited that up, afterwards?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[doctor] Did you notice any blood when you vomit?[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK. And, um, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> did you eat anything that you think might of been bad, or anything that could have caused the tummy pain?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/>. OK.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK. It's very unlikely for an inhaler to cause tummy pain, like this. Normally, it's when you eat, um, bad food or food that has gone off, and you normally get symptoms like you have suggested. But just to  double-check, have you noticed any problems with your breathing?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. And how about chest, have you noticed any chest pain?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. And how about, um, walking and talking, are those all both OK?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Yep. And when you press on your tummy, does it cause any pain?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] OK.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Sorry, I was just writing some things down.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] So, what it sounds like to me is that you might have eaten something bad, and it's causing your tummy pain. And it's <UNIN/>, this is normally called gastroenteritis, so, an infection of the tummy.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Normally, when patients have this <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> do some things. Number one is to drink lots of water and fluids, because you're losing lots at the moment. Number two is to make sure and look out for any fevers, so, if you start getting a temperature then you need <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[doctor] And please stay home for the time being until you get slightly better.[doctor] And normally,[doctor] Normally, things like antibiotics don't help, they make the situation worse.[doctor] So, that's.[doctor] Go ahead.[doctor] So, I think that's what we should do for the time being, if you feel you're getting much worse, than I would suggest you go and see your GP in real, in real life, in person, so they can loot at your belly.[doctor] Great! Cool! Do you have any more questions for me?[doctor] Yes.[doctor] So, the, the things that you've told me are most suggestive of an infection of your tummy and less likely to be something your father had, but if your things don't get worse, then that's something that we can look up from the GP.[doctor] Does that sound OK?[doctor] Thank you <UNIN/>.[doctor] Bye bye.","S (Subjective):

Is that correct?[patient] Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] OK, can you tell me a little bit more about your chest discomfort? When it started, and how you're feeling at the moment?[patient] No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.[patient] Yep.[patient] So <UNIN/> in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.[patient] Uh, on the left side.[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[doctor] OK.[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[doctor] Great. So, you've talked about your chest. Are you still in, discomfort at the moment?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, and when it started, how would you rate it out, out of ten?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] OK, <UNIN/>.[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] OK, and how about now?[doctor] OK, and tell me before this happened, what were you doing?[patient] Uh, no.[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK, and how often do you do gardening?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] OK, and are you normally fit and well? So, are you <UNIN/> normally OK to garden as you would?[doctor] Great, and apart from this, do you have any other medical problems?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] OK, so that's high blood pressure, and high cholesterol. Do you take any medicines for that?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK, and are you allergic to anything?[doctor] OK. So, let me summarise what you've told me already. You were gardening a few hours ago, and you experienced chest discomfort, which was roughly seven out of ten.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And it feels more like someone's sitting on your chest, as opposed to pain.[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] And apart from this, have you noticed anything else unusual, specifically with your breathing?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] OK, and is that getting worse or better?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] And when you get short of breath, when you're walking up the stairs, have you noticed any pain?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK. So, let me confirm. You have the pressure at the moment, and you have shortness of breath, is that correct?[patient] No.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] <UNIN/>. So, given what you've told me about your past medical history. I think it might be worth, you calling an ambulance.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> get you to the hospital as soon as possible. Because, my concern is, it might be something to do with your heart.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] So, While <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> to you, I will ring an ambulance. Who, should come to your address.[doctor] But in the meantime, I think we should stay on the phone. So I can gather some more information, that we can give to the paramedics. Is that OK?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] It's nothing to worry about at the moment, but, given that you've got high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and you've got some chest pain. I'm always worried about the heart first, before anything else.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/>, and we, and we need to look after your heart before anything else.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] So, apart from this <UNIN/> light-headedness, and this chest discomfort, have you <UNIN/> noticed anything else unusual?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Did you have anything to eat or drink this morning?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And you feel, still feel nauseous at the moment?[patient] Okay.[doctor] So, I have a couple of other questions to ask you, and I'm gonna reel them off. So, apologies for not letting you talk very much.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Have you noticed this pressure, radiating to your head?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] And how about to your left, or right arm?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] And does that pain go anywhere else? To your left arm, or to your back?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And, have you noticed any problems swallowing, or drinking water?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Good.[doctor] And have you noticed any problems going to the loo?[patient] Okay.[doctor] And you're normally fit and well, apart from the two things you told me about?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] And, do you live at home with your wife at the moment?[doctor] OK. I would suggest, if she's there, you let her know that, you'll both be having an adventure to the hospital today. So, she might need to get your things together.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] The ambulance should be there very soon. In the meantime, I would suggest that you stay calm, and have some water if you need to.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] Don't take any of those medications.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] And the paramedics should be with you, very shortly.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] So, when they do come, there are two things they will be worried about.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] The one is your chest, so, your heart. And the second is your breathing, which is your lungs.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] So, they will give you lots of things to breathe through, and attach things to your arms. Just to check, things like your blood pressure, and your heart rate. So, don't be worried.[doctor] And, when you get to the hospital, you'll be seen by a consultant, pretty, pretty much immediately.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[doctor] Sure. So, I will let the paramedics do their job. And when, you're at the hospital, the consultant would normally call me within a couple of minutes, to let me know how everything's going.[doctor] Great. I'll um, book another appointment, to see you soon. Uh, <UNIN/>, once you've had your adventure.[doctor] No problems. Do you have any questions for me?[doctor] Great, thank you very much.[doctor] Bye bye.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>","S (Subjective):

I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] So, there's two ways of us doing this. The first is, I can call an ambulance. Or, you can take yourself to the hospital with baby.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] Which one would you prefer?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Sure.

And, those can either be found in the legs or your chest, so in your lungs.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] It's quite a common thing to happen. And, it's not something to worry about. But, needs to be checked out in the hospital first.[patient] Okay.[doctor] And, if it, if that does become the case, they can give you something to reduce the clot.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Fairly quick process.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Good.

When they do come, do you have any idea the headache is going to come?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] So, it's normally at work?[doctor] OK. And, where does the headache sit in your head? Is it the front, or the back?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. And, does it <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> else?[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] Does it go anywhere else?[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] And, when you have the headaches, specifically, do you feel sick?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] OK.[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] OK.[doctor] And, do you normally get headaches, before all of this started?[patient] Yep.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods.

Or do you speak to people?[doctor] OK.[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] And, these things have happened mostly when you're sitting at your computer?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] OK, and tell me, what did you do, before being a lawyer?[doctor] OK.[doctor] So, talk to me about the stress that you're under at the moment. If, uh, ten out of ten is, extremely stressful, and one out of ten is being on vacation. Where would <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> moment?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] And, is that normal for you?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK.[doctor] So, you mentioned your headaches. You also mentioned your reduced appetite. So, you don't want to eat as much.[patient] No.[doctor] Have you lost weight?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Can you remember how much you've lost?[doctor] And, is that because you're going to the gym? Or is that unintentional?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK. So, have you noticed your clothes feeling looser?[doctor] And, have people said, or commented that you've lost weight?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Great. And, another thing that you also mentioned. Is that you noticed tingling in your hand.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] So, talk to me about that. Is it in one hand? Or both hands?[doctor] And, do you get that in your legs as well?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] And, what does it feel like, the tingling?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[doctor] And again, is this the first time you've noticed this?[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK.[doctor] And the other two things that I've just, jotted down. Is, you're feeling hot, but you didn't mention that.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Is that correct?[doctor] OK.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Yes. So, do you feel short of breath while you're sitting at your desk?[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/>. OK. And, how about when you're exercising?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[doctor] And the last thing is. You mentioned that you noticed your heart beating?[doctor] Again, how often do you get that?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK. How long has that been happening for?[patient] Okay.[doctor] Fine. And, apart from all of these things that you've told me. Do you have any other medical problems?[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. And, do you take medications for that?[patient] Yep.[doctor] And, are you remembering to take your medications?[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. And, do you drink or smoke?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] How much do you drink?[doctor] OK. And, how about smoking?[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] And, uh, I need to ask this to all of my patients, but do you do anything else recreational, in terms of drugs?[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. So, you've never taken cocaine, or marijuana?[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] OK, thank you. And, are you allergic to anything?[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Good. So, you've told me lots of things happening to you at the moment, and I can understand, they probably feel quite strange and unusual.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Um, I think the best course of action is, you come and see, one of our doctors, in the clinic.[doctor] We can give you an examination, and what that means is, we check your heart and your breathing.[doctor] Make sure that those things are functioning correctly.[doctor] And probably do some blood tests, for your thyroxine.[doctor] And take it from there. How does that sound?[doctor] I think before we give you any medications, we should see you in person.[doctor] So, what we're going to do is book an appointment. Or I think you can book an appointment through the app, to come and see us <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> clinic, and see one of my colleagues.[doctor] I'll let them know what you've told me today, so you won't have to repeat exactly what you've said.[doctor] Great. Do you have any questions?[doctor] Thank you very much.","S (Subjective):

Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK. It would be helpful if you could get a thermometer from the pharmacy and, do check your temperature, just to make sure that it isn't, going up and down.[doctor] Um, normally we can treat this infection without having to test your urine. Uh, with, with a course of antibiotics.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Um, how do you feel about that? Are you happy to take a course of antibiotics?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] It would just be for three days.[doctor] Um.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Yes, so I can send a prescription through to your requested pharmacy for that. If you take them, as soon as you can, get them, pick them up as soon as you can, and start taking them.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] The other thing which is important to do is to drink, lots of water. So, two and a half to three litres a day.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, you can get some cranberry juice and take, drink that as well, that sometimes helps. And also some, sachets um, which you can get from the chemist, some sachets which just help change the acidity of your urine. So I, I can put the details of that on your notes.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Um, if you feel like your pain is getting worse or not settling, you get lower back pain, um, or you're getting a high temperature, or you have any problems actually passing urine. Then it's very important that we speak to you again.[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, the other thing is that if it becomes a, common, thing or a recurrent problem. Then we need to talk to you again about it.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] No, not if you're better. If you're, if you feel like your symptoms get worse at any point, or they're not resolving with the treatment. Or you keep getting a similar, um, you keep getting a similar, problem, reccurently. Then it's important for us to talk, talk to you in more detail about that.[patient] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, have you got any other questions?[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, so have you already requested a pharmacy through Babylon?[patient] Okay.[doctor] Can I just check that with you?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, that's fine.

Before this did you have any similar times in your life when you felt like this?[doctor] OK. And what about your mood day-to-day? I mean, I can see that you're quite distressed by like that. Do you ever get really down about this?[doctor] When do you think you last felt yourself?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. And has your mood ever been so low that you've felt like you just couldn't carry on with your job, or with your life, or with your normal, uh, things as they we're going on?[doctor] Yeah. OK.

Have you <UNIN/>, have you talked to anyone, talked to any counsellors? Done any, online, looked online at all? Any ways to <UNIN/>?[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK.[doctor] And would you be happy to, have, some one-to-one therapy?[doctor] OK. I mean what we would suggest in the first instance is to, to. So you can self-refer via the NHS, for what we call like, talking therapy which is a type of inter-behavioural, where they can really look at your situation. How you're reacting to, the, <UNIN/>, why, what's provoking anxiety, and what you can do, to try and overcome that.[doctor] Um, so I can send you the link for that.[doctor] Um, in the meantimes it can be a bit of a wait. There are some online resources that are really helpful. Um, can put the details, on there and you can, get on with them straight away and try and work through them as well.[doctor] Um, and if you're feeling like it's not helping at all, or your anxiety is getting worse, to the point where you can't cope with work, or you can't, just do your normal things day-to-day. Then, it's important for us to, for you to give us a call, back and just discuss that, further.[doctor] I mean some people, with anxiety they, do need to take medication to control that but that's, not something that we'd suggest in the first instance.[doctor] And I'll put some more information on your notes about, helping with your, sleep patterns and things like that.[doctor] Um, in terms of palpitations, it is most likely to be a, <UNIN/>, associated with anxiety, but it's probably worth having couple of basic blood tests just to make sure that, there's not something triggering that off. And then arranging a GP follow-up a week after you've had the tests, so we can just go through the results with you.[doctor] So if you call the support line you can arrange the, to have the blood test done.[doctor] OK?[doctor] All right.

Was there anything else you'd hoped about getting from this?[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Sure, yeah, no, absolutely. Well, I'm really glad you have <UNIN/> talked to me today. I think what we can do is, is give you a prescription for, uh, some more of the inhalers. We can get that to you, within the hour, I would hope.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, and, uh, I think, what, the other thing I'd like to do is just give you a, dose of steroids. So this is, these are tablets which, um, you can take for five days. Uh, two tablets in the morning.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] And, uh, that should just dampen down your asthmatic response, OK.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Um, now there are some side effects to the steroids. Which I should really tell you about, but please read the label, that's associated with. Don't be too worried about the side effects.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] They're <UNIN/>, most, you know <UNIN/>, most of the time the steroids are, very well tolerated. And, uh, you <UNIN/>. Have you had them in the past, do you know of?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Have you had steroids in the past?[doctor] Probably, yeah I would <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> too. So, um, they, they can come, they can make you, your mood change, can be slightly low or <UNIN/> too, slightly high.[doctor] Can give you, a high blood sugar, um, and, uh, their. Uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, they can also cause rash, nausea, um, headaches, but, mostly is well-tolerated, and it should help your asthma an awful lot.[doctor] Um, uh, what I'd like to do is, is send you these, the, some prescriptions for your, uh, inhalers, <UNIN/>, ongoing. So you, um, you can, once you get better from this asthma attack, you can, you can, use the Clenil Modulite in the morning, with Ventolin as a PRN. <UNIN/>, so, a Ventolin when you need to, um, when you're getting wheezy.[doctor] If you should start to use the Ventolin more than, uh, every three hours.[doctor] Uh, at, at anytime, it's a good idea to seek medical attention. So, um, see a doctor, um, in some capacity.[doctor] Uh, and, the other thing I'd like to send you is a spacer, which would allow the medication to actually, go into your lungs better. Have you, do you know what a spacer is? Have you used one before?[doctor] Have you got one?[doctor] OK. All right. Well, um, I'll send you another one, and it has some instructions about how to use it, but essentially, uh, couple of puffs to prime it, inside, breathing in and out, um, uh, for five or <UNIN/>, five or ten breaths.[doctor] Uh, yeah. So.[doctor] Uh, was there anything else that was on your mind? Or you're concerned about at this stage?[doctor] OK, and, and uh, I might give you some time off work as well. You can self-certify first seven days, but uh, I think I would advise you just to, rest a little bit until you're feeling a bit better, if you're OK with that. All right?[doctor] OK. No worries. Any deterioration in your symptoms, like worsening shortness of breath. Um, or just generally concerning symptoms, uh, pain in your chest tightness, uh, feeling light-headed.[doctor] Uh, then, seek further medical attention anytime please. OK?[doctor] OK.

Any allergies to any medications at all?[doctor] OK. So, what you've described to me, it sounds like you, you probably have got an infection in the chest, um, because it's, it, you know, you're obviously getting symptoms of from your nose and your chest. Um, it sounds like you might have a high temperature, it's definitely worth getting a thermometer and checking your temperature.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Yeah, and most of the time, these infections are caused by viruses, so they do normally settle by themselves. But it can take, you know, a week or two, um, and you can <UNIN/> persistently have the cough ongoing longer than that.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Um, the important thing to do would be to take your temperature.[doctor] Um, and if you feel like, if the temperature's ongoing, above thirty seven point five, thirty eight, um, and you keep spiking temperatures and that's not settling down, or your cough's getting worse, you're coughing up lots of nasty phlegm or you cough up any blood or get blood coming out your nose,[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] um, or any shortness of breath, chest pain, then we certainly would need to speak to you again. With the diabetes you are a bit more likely to get a bacterial infection than if you didn't have the diabetes, so it's something we do need to be careful of.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] Yeah, potentially. If it is, if it's not settling or the temperature's ongoing, getting worse, then we definitely need to talk to you again.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Um, have you got any other questions?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] It's fine to carry on what you're doing at the moment, with the lemsip. I wouldn't take, and that, that contains paracetamol so don't take any other paracetamol containing products, um, with that at the same time.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] Um, the cough syrup isn't advisable in the daytime because it's best for your body if you just keep coughing. But if you're kept up all night and you can't sleep at all, then it, it's OK to have a little bit of cough syrup, just to settle that down.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK? Do you have blood sugar checking equipment? Do you check? No, OK. Well, if you make sure that you have the regular diabetes and blood pressure checkups that your GP has asked you for?[doctor] OK, great. Alright then, take care. Bye.","S (Subjective):

Bye.[doctor] I think it's probably important to get a sample of the stool, so we can make sure that you haven't got a nasty bacterial infection which needs specific treatment.[doctor] Um, and we should also check that you're not getting dehydrated, because if you're, if you're not keeping fluid down, then you can get dehydrated.[doctor] Um, so.[doctor] Yeah. So you need to carry on with your rehydration salts, and just have very small amounts. It's a positive sign that you passed urine an hour ago. So, you're obviously still, um, hydrated enough to pass urine.[doctor] But we, um, we should see you so that we can check your hydration and, um, get that sample sent off as soon as possible.[doctor] 'cause if, if, if you come into the clinic, you can send that sample off straightaway. Otherwise, we would have to post it out to you which would take time.[doctor] Um, so we can, we can make you an urgent appointment, um, and then you can, you can get the sample sent off and we can check your hydration. Um, but if, in the meantime, you're feeling more unwell, then we would get you seen urgently in A and E.[doctor] So you can call us back in the meantime.[doctor] Yeah. If you keep drinking, keep going with the rehydration salts. Just tiny sips constantly, to <UNIN/> so that your stomach doesn't get overfilled and, and you vomit, so just tiny, tiny sips but just keep going with it.[doctor] Um, and just have very simple food, if you're gonna have anything, like toast or biscuit or something really light like that. Avoid, um, fruit, vegetables, uh, milk, anything like that, which might just make it worse.[doctor] OK. So you'll have to book an appointment through the support line.[doctor] Right, OK.

Or is your mood low?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days.

And uh, so lower mood, decreased sex drive recently as well.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] And, just on that note, just a few questions around that.[doctor] Are you able to, uh, it may be slightly personal questions, but if you're O. O. K. to answer this,[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] Do you tend to, to have morning erections like you, is that something that you've noticed, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] So, you've not, so you're saying you have not noticed morning erections, and usually you would. So, <UNIN/> normal thing to have, uh, waking up in the morning with something. But you have not noticed those recently.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. So, and that's been a change, has it?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[doctor] Sorry?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Uh, so you, you, you, you don't think there's been a change there. You[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Ohh OK, sorry. Right, so[doctor] OK. So, um,[doctor] Just going back to the mood symptoms as well. Uh, you <UNIN/> have had uh, difficulty focusing, easily distracted. Your mood has been uh, slightly lower, with lower sex drive.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Um, and in what way has your sex drive been lower? <UNIN/> are you in a relationship at the moment?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Disinterested.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK. Sorry, you froze there for a moment.[doctor] Um, <UNIN/>. So less interested as well, OK.[patient] Yep.[doctor] And, just to ask you a few questions before we <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> uh, wrap up is, uh, any significant past medical history?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, so do you suffer from any, uh, mental health problems in the past, or any, uh, physical health problems? <UNIN/>[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Hypo?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Hyperthyroid.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] K, so that's high thyroid, just to sort of confirm that.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] <UNIN/> hyper, as in high, hyperthyroid.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Hypo, OK. Hypothyroid. Thank you.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK. And um,[doctor] Uh, do you take any medications?[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Do you, do you continue to take Thyrocsin now?[doctor] You do. You're, so you're taking Thyrocsin at the moment?[doctor] Cool. And any drug allergies? Are you allergic to any medications?[doctor] No.[doctor] No allergies. And you mentioned the <UNIN/>, the suicide of your father fifteen years ago. I'm very sorry to hear that. Is there any other, um, uh, <UNIN/> significant family history of medical conditions, or psychiatric conditions?[doctor] No depression or anything like that running in your family, or uh, <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. And your mother is, is well? Any brothers or sisters?[doctor] Um,[doctor] OK.[doctor] So, I just uh, uh, sorry it might seem like a slightly random question, but any uh, change in vision?[doctor] No  <UNIN/>[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. OK. And, just to go back to your, you were saying you had low mood. Some people who <UNIN/>, who do have low mood, uh, and low sex drive can sometimes feel uh, suicidal as well. Have you had any thoughts of harming yourself or harming anyone else?[doctor] No.[doctor] <UNIN/> and are you able to get the usual enjoyment out of your daily activities, that you have done in the past?[doctor] OK. So you, you've become more short of breath over the last few months.[doctor] Um, and you've had a[doctor] OK. So uh, any other things around that? So, more fatigue, more shortness of breath, um, over the last few months?[doctor] Um, with a <UNIN/> low, lower mood, decreased sex drive. Um, is there, just before we wrap up, is there anything else that you would like to talk about?[doctor] So, um,[doctor] We're getting a little bit towards the end now, but I would quite like to make a bit more of a plan for you. Um,[doctor] I would like to, probably see you in person, and do an examination. And, and also, we would probably like to do some blood tests um, as well.[doctor] So, do you think it would be possible to see uh, to to book an appointment in the next few days uh, with your GP? Or, or um, that would be ideal, I think here.[doctor] Um, and then we can, we can probably do some more uh, we'll do an examination and uh, do some investigations really, to see what's going on here a little bit more.[doctor] Is that alright?[doctor] OK.[doctor] Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I think <UNIN/>, I definitely think we need a plan here. Um, it's been nice talking to you. I'm sorry, we've run out of time now.[doctor] Uh, but we've at least started the ball rolling with um, some further investigations and tests.[doctor] I'm glad you're, you know, you're, you're <UNIN/>, you're, although you have a low mood, um, you're, you're, um, you're not <UNIN/> feeling suicidal, just to confirm that.[doctor] And, and you're, uh, and uh, we'll hopefully get to the bottom of some your tiredness, and your other symptoms, when we see you. OK?[doctor] OK. Thank you. Thanks.","S (Subjective):

If you've had these flashing lights, and things like that.[doctor] Well <UNIN/>, some <UNIN/>, so that pill if you were having <UNIN/>, regular migraines with um, flashing lights, or <UNIN/>, other symptoms. It wouldn't be suitable to stay on that pill, particularly, we'd have to change it to something else.[doctor] But you can carry on with that for the moment.[doctor] Have you got any other questions?[doctor] Uh.[doctor] Yeah, if you book an appointment with the support team, then we can do a full examination then.[doctor] All right then.

Bye.[doctor] OK, and, do you take any other medications, apart from the ones you told me about?[doctor] OK. And, any problems with your stomach, or asthma, indigestion, acid reflux?[doctor] <UNIN/>. And, what I would suggest is, definitely carrying on with the ice therapy that you've been using. So, as much as you can, 'cause that really does make a difference to injuries.[doctor] Brings the healing blood into the area, and it gives it the best chance of, getting better. So, as much as you can, use the ice.[doctor] Um, obviously you're trying to stick to a marathon programme, but.[doctor] Um, I would, try and ease up on the running, if you can. And if it, if it's painful enough that you're, having to stop running, then it's not a good idea, to do that.[doctor] Um. It's fine to take the Ibuprofen. Um, I can prescribe you a slightly stronger, anti-inflammatory that you can take regularly instead of the Ibuprofen, but not with the Ibuprofen.[doctor] But make sure that with food. Ultimately we probably need to, examine the knee.[doctor] Um, so, the best thing I would, suggest, getting a appointment with the physiotherapist first, who can do like a long, assessment, and examination of the knee.[doctor] And then we can make an assessment as to whether we need to do any, um, imagery to <UNIN/>, have a look inside the knee, and see if there's any problem with the, cartilage.[doctor] Um, it's, it's not really possible to, diagnose that over the <UNIN/>, over the video. So we definitely would need to, see you. And, the, a physio is the best point of call, because they'll probably be the most likely initial treatment.[doctor] But certainly if the appointment time's too long to wait, then we can see, we can see you in our clinic as well.[doctor] Yep, <UNIN/> we can, we can do a referral before that. If in the meantime you develop like persistant swelling, heat, redness, um, of the knee, or high temperature, feel unwell, or it completely locks up and you can't bend and stretch it.[doctor] Then, you'd need to see a doctor urgently, so call us back <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> in that, case. <UNIN/>.[doctor] OK. I'll send it through to your pharmacy for you. OK? Thank you, bye.","S (Subjective):

primock_/day3_consultation10,"[doctor] Hello, hi, I'm Doctor Jacob and welcome to Babylon. Hello.[patient] Hello, how are you?[doctor] <UNIN/> Nice to meet you too. So just before we start, is it all right if you could confirm your name for me please?[patient] Oh hey, um, I've just had some diarrhea for the last three days, um, and it's been affecting me I need to stay close to the toilet. And, um, yeah, it's been affecting my day-to-day activities.[doctor] And your date of birth?[doctor] OK, and your address for me please.[doctor] OK and that's correct, and just to confirm that you're in a secure location and we can have a confidential conversation.[patient] Yeah, so it's like loose and watery stool, going to the toilet quite often, uh and like some pain in my, like, lower stomach?[doctor] OK, uh, you've mentioned on our notes that you're suffering from bad diarrhea. I'm sorry to hear about it. So if you tell me a bit more about it, please.[patient] Um, probably like six or seven times a day? Yeah.[doctor] OK.[patient] No, no blood, yeah, just watery and loose stool.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] So <UNIN/> in my lower abdomen, so, uh, like, um...yeah, just to one side.[doctor] Mmm.[patient] Uh, on the left side.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[doctor] So you haven't had anything from outside? Nothing dodgy anything <UNIN/>? No.[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Repeat that please, that wasn't clear. What did you say?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> After that we'd said something.[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] OK, right, and with the diarrhea, how many times a day are you going to the toilet?[doctor] Four to five times, yeah. And is there any? And it's like water? Is it like water or is it just loose?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] Are you going like water? Or is it just, you know bit, bit of <UNIN/> solid stools, bit loose kind of thing?[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] Sure OK. Bit of both and is there any blood or mucus?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] It's like the snotty stuff.[doctor] Yeah, it looks like snot <UNIN/>.[doctor] No, so no mucus, OK. Any fever at all?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Are you still able to eat, and drink?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Sure. So but you're you're still able to drink quite a bit yeah? You're drinking plenty.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Excellent.[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] OK, and, um, what have you take, have you taken anything so far for the diarrhea?[doctor] Nothing yet, OK. Anything for the abdominal pain?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] OK. Right, and any <UNIN/> unfortunately we don't have any of your past medical history, is there anything you'd like to say?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK and uh, are you, any, uh, anything else other than asthma?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Yeah <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[doctor] Ohh dear, OK. Bowel cancer. Ten years ago. And how old was he when he died?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] K, and um, you mentioned you had asthma, are you using any inhalers at all?[patient] No.[doctor] Which ones?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Sorry?[doctor] <UNIN/> Laxepro.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] OK, not heard of it may. Is it like Salbutamol? Is it like a blue colour?[doctor] Yellow, OK. I'll have to check that one, not sure. Laxepro.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] OK. Um, that's fine. Any other medication that you're using?[doctor] <UNIN/> Over the counter, anything at all?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> OK. Right. Any allergies?[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] No allergies at all, righty <UNIN/>. Fine so, obviously, you know you just have diarrhea it's about four to five times a day. Um, you're still drinking plenty and you look like you're not dehydrated which is a good sign, OK? Um, when we start worrying about diarrhea is if you're going more than eight times a day.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] That means probably you are, you know, whatever you're eating is going straight through, OK? You still need to drink plenty of water because you're losing a lot of fluids.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, when you go to the toilet. Um, things that one would advise is a soft diet. So avoid dairy, fish, meat, eggs, while you're having the diarrhea. Go, sorry?[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, so that will be like crackers, toast, jam, those kind of things that's easily digested. Like what we are good give babies yeah. When they start eating you give, simple food for babies. You don't give eggs or meat the first time they start feeding. So that's the kind of soft diet we're talking about, yeah? Once you are able to, you know keep most of it in, you can start off with some just boiled vegetables and mash.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Once you're OK with that for about forty-eight hours then you can start having meat. So just don't have meat <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> once you feel like you're slightly better, because you might go back to square one again, all right?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <UNIN/> Forty-eight hours you're not having any diarrhea, you're fine then you can go and start having meat, egg, fish and all. So that <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] No, no, no <UNIN/> preferably just don't because, what why do we say this? It's because it takes much more time for meat to get digested. So because your gut flora, you know, the, the, the bacteria in your gut is not you know as it should be, it takes a bit more effort for one to digest these food.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] While it doesn't take that much of an effort to, you know digest mash and vegetables. Does that make sense?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Yeah? So, um, at the same time you could have some, although you can't <UNIN/> milk is not a good idea, yoghurts are a good idea because they are probiotics, it help to build up the normal, um gut, gut bacteria back.[doctor] OK.[doctor] So those kinda, now, things to look out for, if your diarrhoea doesn't go away in a week's time, or if you're passing blood, we need a stool sample, because that means you <UNIN/> you may have <UNIN/>, um, some particular bugs that might need treatment with antibiotics.[doctor] OK. If you're again, as I've mentioned previously if you're going about six to eight times a day, that means there's a high chance that, uh, you are, having <UNIN/> dehydration and you might need to go into hospital at that point in time. If that happens you get in touch with us again, all right?[doctor] Any questions? You look a bit confused.[doctor] Yeah? OK and also you could get something called Dioralyte over the counter. So, it helps to uh, replenish your, the salts that you've been, that's lost through going to the toilet.[doctor] OK? If you're a bit confused you know you can actually, uh, all this is all recorded in your app. So you can go back. I'll put that all in detail so if, you know I know sometimes it's a bit difficult to process everything, you can go back and read, read the notes.[doctor] Is that OK?[doctor] All right then, you take care.[doctor] Bye now, bye bye.","S (Subjective):

I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] OK? So that's what we need to <UNIN/>.

Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] I would still like you to be seen by one of our doctors to take a look inside your ears to just make sure. So this is like just symptomatic relief like you have a fever we just give paracetamol.  So just to, you know, make you able to come and see one of the doctors and things like that.[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] <UNIN/> while you're with the doctors, we'd like to do your blood pressure, just examine your, you know, you know, how your walking and everything is.[doctor] OK, while we're waiting, while you're waiting on seeing the doctor if you double up any weakness of your legs or arms or, or, you know, a sudden headache.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Any of those symptoms, or you start being violently sick with it, then you know, you would need to take your <UNIN/> to A and E.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[doctor] But if not, wait for the appointment <UNIN/> for the doctor to examine you um and we'll take it from there.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] So i'll, i'll send the a prescription at cross <UNIN/> pharmacy looks like it's the Lloyd pharmacy on our system. Is that correct?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Yeah. So we'll send you across that prescription. Um, it's called <UNIN/> , yeah? It's one tablet three times a day. So I'll give you <UNIN/> about ten days worth.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] In the interim, obviously in the next few days, you'll get to see one of my doctors and we'll have to just take it from there.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Any questions at all?[doctor] It doesn't really matter, you can take it, because sometimes, you know, you get the symptoms as soon as you wake up, so probably you'll feel a bit sick to eat anything so might as well just take the tablets.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Just make sure you call support to book that appointment, OK?[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> Bye bye now. Bye[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah.

OK, so from what you're describing,[patient] No.[doctor] It looks like, you know, it is quite widespread, your eczema.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Yeah?

So you don't, you don't use it everyday, so you just use it on and off, yeah?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Blue inhalers. But your breathing's all OK, yeah?[doctor] Yeah.[doctor] Sure. <UNIN/> So, what we need to do is, obviously, you've got <UNIN/>, as I've mentioned. So, extensive eczema.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] What we'll do, we need a couple of minutes. Because to keep your a bit comfortable, we'll, you would probably need some antihistamines, which I'm going to prescribe.[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Also, hydrocortisone is a baby steroid that you use for young children. You might probably need a bit more stronger one, like betnovateor something like that. OK?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] So we'll try that first. So I'm going to <UNIN/> it's called the antihistamine is called Fexofenadine. And then we'll try with some Betnovate first. So it's like very small amount, like it's like one fingertip.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Yeah. This much is, is enough to cover your palms.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] And your - back of your hands, yeah?  So it's very small amounts, so that if you can imagine you can cover with a very small amount the whole body.[doctor] Yeah. So use that. You, you have to use it twice a day, for the next couple of weeks.[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK. If, if there's no improvement, you need to get back to us. Or, if you have any kind of adverse reaction, like an allergic reaction, which is unlikely, but if it still happens you need to get in touch with us. OK?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/> So, what we're going to do is, we're going to send off the prescription to your pharmacy. It looks like Boots on the systems, is that correct?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Yeah? Yes, so i'll send it across to Boot's. And it will be there for <UNIN/> collecting.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] If things are getting worse in the next two weeks, call us before hand. Otherwise, wait for two weeks, take the medication and the cream.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] You still need to continue on your, emollients like the dermal soap, and, as well as the, diprovate. Yeah, so you still need to use those, in the interim. Any questions at all?[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] OK then. You take care then. Bye bye now.[patient] Okay, thank you.

There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] Uh, any joints swollen or tender or sore?[doctor] OK, alright.[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Alright, <UNIN/> and, um, have you got any kind of symptoms down below when you're passing urine?[doctor] OK. Any painful urination at all?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] Are you passing urine more often than normal?[patient] No.[doctor] OK. Have you been abroad anywhere recently?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[doctor] Where have you been?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Uh, and, um, uh, did you take malaria preventative medication when you went out there?[doctor] Which one did you take?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] Was it a weekly tablet or a daily tablet?[doctor] OK, um, and was it one tablet or was it another one that you would take on top of the first one?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] OK.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] And, and what were you doing out in Vietnam? Was it just seeing the cities or going through villages or hiking? What what kind of activities were you doing?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. Uh, and um, did you do any kind of, were you in rivers or things like that? Were you, you know, <UNIN/> how adventurous were you?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Where you going out into the rivers? Were you going on beaches? I mean how adventurous was your trip?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Right, OK. Um, thank you for sharing that with me. Now, do you have, um, any other illnesses at all, in the past?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] And that back pain have you, um, have you seen anyone about that?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] Have they, have they give you any kind of diagnosis at all?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] Alright um, are there any illnesses in your family at all?[patient] Yep.[patient] Okay.[doctor] I'm sorry to hear that. Um, how old was he when that happened?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. Um, are you on any medication at all?[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] OK. Uh, <UNIN/> do you have any allergies at all? <UNIN/> medication?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] OK, so hay fever.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Alright. Um, are you, um, you're working at the moment?[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] What do you work at?[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] OK, all right. Um, and, um, you're up to date with all the vaccinations, Hepatitis B, and that kind of thing?[doctor] OK.[doctor] So, I can <UNIN/>.[doctor] Sure, OK. Um, and, are you a, uh, are you a smoker at all?[doctor] OK, and ohh do you drink much alcohol?[doctor] OK, and how much kind of physical exercise do you do normally?[doctor] OK, that's good, alright, um, so, um[doctor] What, uh, I think we're gonna need to do is we're gonna need to bring you into one of our clinics. Examine <UNIN/>, and we're gonna need to arrange some blood tests as well.[doctor] OK, um, so, what what I want to do is, the first question I have in my mind is that we need to find a reason for why you've got this <UNIN/> fever and these symptoms, because there's no apparent reason from what you've told me.[doctor] There's no, uh, when someone has got fever and sweats, we want to find out have they got chest infection, have they got a throat infection?[doctor] Um, and if we can't find a focus of infection, then that's something, that, that's an outstanding question that needs to be answered, OK?[doctor] Um, the second thing, second factor, is that you've recently come from, uh, Vietnam.[doctor] And you've had exposure to rural areas. And we need to think about things like malaria or other exotic infections as well. So, um, you're probably gonna need some blood tests.[doctor] After you've been seen by somebody.[doctor] Um, now, the urgency of those blood tests depends partly on what we find when we examine you, which is why we're going to go, go for the examination first.[doctor] You <UNIN/> come into one of our clinics in central London, that's one option, and then the the GP there who examines you can then decide on how urgent the blood tests and things are going to be.[doctor] Or, if it's inconvenient for you to come into central London because you <UNIN/> you're living further out, you could actually just attend a local A and E.[doctor] I'm going to type up what my thought process is and what kind of test I think you need in the notes for this appointment, so you could show that to them at reception.[doctor] Um, I'll be asking for something called thick and thin blood films, to check for malaria.[doctor] And inflammatory markers and things like those, <UNIN/> technical terms, but they'll understand what that, what I'm talking about.[doctor] But, um, I, I don't think you can go into work, uh, until we've sorted this out. And we, we, we need to sort this out sooner rather than later.[doctor] OK.[doctor] OK, fine, so what I'm going to do is I will send a message to one of our admin team members asking them to book you in.[doctor] And if you can ring the number that I leave in your consultation notes, after a few minutes, and then they'll slot you in, and then we can sort things out from there. OK?[doctor] Alright then, OK. Take care then. All the best.[doctor] Bye.","S (Subjective):

Um.[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, well, normally at this stage I like to proceed to examination, but um, based on your uh, story.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, it's difficult. I think that, you know, <UNIN/>, you've, essentially the story is you've got a dry itchy rash on your, mainly your hands. you mentioned. Um and your arms which started, perhaps after swimming a few days ago.[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] Um, but no other symptoms, you're feeling otherwise, well, no fevers, no bleeding or discharge from skin.[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] I wonder whether you may have something called dermatitis. Um, have you heard of that condition before?[doctor] OK. Um, great. Well I can give you a patient information leaflet about that, which gives a bit more information about the disease, but, um, it, it's something that we can readily treated. Um.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yep.[doctor] With couple options, we have steroid creams I can give you, um, which will help with the inflammation.[patient] Yep.[doctor] And, uh, something called emollients, which can help with the dry, dry skin.[patient] Okay.[doctor] And that's something you just need to kind of paste on, uh, on to your skin, uh, <UNIN/>, throughout the day for the next few days. Um, and hopefully that helps your symptoms.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] Um, <UNIN/>, you can also try antihistamines, so you can get things over the counter, Piriton, Loratadine, they can sometimes help with the itchiness.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK. And um, that's probably what I recommend. Paracetamol on this occasion, wouldn't be helpful.[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Um, uh, uh, painkillers wouldn't be helpful <UNIN/>, on this occasion, but let's, let's, let's see how the next few days go.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[doctor] And if it's still not getting better, come back and see me next week, and we can have another look again, at your symptoms.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] Right.

And what have you taken so far for your headache?[patient] Yeah, it feels, um, like a cramp, like a muscular cramp, and, um, yeah i feel a bit uh weak and shaky.[doctor] <UNIN/> OK. so just a few more questions, with regards to your headache  So do you find it difficult to look at the light?[patient] Uh, it comes and goes.[patient] Uh...no, just maybe my stomach.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK. Uh, and is it any pain when you try to move your neck from side to side, look up and down, is there any pain?[patient] Um, yeah, it doesn't feel like -- yeah, it just makes me feel weak. I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] OK, all over. Right, and have you been sick with this <UNIN/> headache?[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] OK, and do you have a cough?[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] OK, so there's no cough or cold, yeah?[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] OK, and you your ears are OK?

Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] Ohh <UNIN/>[doctor] Okay, and um just a few more questions to you, because I don't have any of your background history. Um, do you suffer from any medical conditions?[patient] Yep.[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] Fine. And no surgical history  then  and no medical surgical complaints, yeah?[doctor] <UNIN/>[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Right, and um, do you have any kind of shivering at all?  Do you shivering with the fever?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> cold, yeah?  OK, right.  And are you using <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>  you mentioned about the paracetamol and <UNIN/>  now, but are you on any <UNIN/> regular, any medication, anything that you're using at all?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] OK.  Um, any allergies at all?[doctor] Alright.[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] OK and... OK, so uh I, I believe that it is quite important for us to actually examine you, yeah?[patient] No.[doctor] Um, it it's not <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>  possible for us to do that online. I think you would need to come into one of our hubs to have a proper examination, and I, I think you would need one quite urgently, OK? So the thing that's <UNIN/> running in the back of my mind are um, kind of a viral illnesses that can one can get with um, sort of mosquito bites or foreign travel.[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] Like <UNIN/>, um <UNIN/> the other common thing around Thailand, it will be like some dengue.  But that would have, like you would have some, uh, blood spots or bleeding or something, which you don't have at the moment, do you?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[doctor] OK. So where is the rash?[patient] Yes, yeah.[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[doctor] How would you describe, how would you describe the rash?[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] Red and itchy. OK. So if you were to put a glass on top of the rash, does that rash go away?[patient] Yeah.[doctor] It goes away. OK.[doctor] OK. So <UNIN/> what we need to do, <UNIN/> need to urgently examine you. And that's sometime today. OK? And um, after our examination there is a high possibility that sometimes we might need to send you to hospital. But I'm not sure as yet. So I'd like you to be seen in one of our hubs as soon as possible?[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] So um, I'll <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> recommend that you would need to be urgently seen by the doctor, preferably in the next few hours time. OK? And um, in any case if that's not available I'd like you to take yourself to <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>. Alright? Any questions at all?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] <UNIN/>, you know obviously when I've spoken to you, you, you didn't tick the box for many theories, but you're in the middle somewhere. Let's put it that way.[patient] Okay.[doctor] Um <UNIN/> you know things like we have to rule out is Meningitis and all, but Ben, you just have a general muscle ache. You didn't say that you had things like, you had problems looking at the light or something <UNIN/> Those are things when you think of Meningitis[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] But and then, it's the uh, in meningitis you get a non-blanching <UNIN/> rash. While in any kind of virus <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> the rash usually goes away. Saying that, we don't know whether these are the beginning stage. So that's why I'd rather, but I would rather you see a <UNIN/> GP as soon as possible, if uh, we've got a slot available. But if not, I think you need to be seen, and maybe have some blood tests and examinations. OK?[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[doctor] All right, you take care, Ben. Bye now. Cheers. Bye.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.","S (Subjective):

You so you can walk about a mile and you don't feel short of breath at all.[patient] Okay.[doctor] OK, so just explain a bit more just make myself clear about the lift thing.  So you said you're short of breath when you're in the lift?[patient] Yeah.[patient] Okay, sure.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <UNIN/> described them like palpitations to me, yeah? So that's what you're, you're feeling your own heartbeat.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[doctor] Yeah, OK.

Uh, any <UNIN/> any past medical history you'd like to share with me today?[doctor] <UNIN/> Sorry you had thyroid problems.[doctor] Ohh yeah, underactive thyroid, yes. Yep.[doctor] Yeah, you're taking thyroxine? Are you using it every day?[doctor] Why is that?[doctor] OK, so is that, so all these things are since you've stopped taking the thyroxine?[doctor] When was your last blood test?[doctor] OK, so you've not had a blood test.[doctor] Right, OK. It could, you know, generally for you know <UNIN/> for underactive thyroids what symptoms you've said um <UNIN/> it's the opposite that usually happens, yeah. It's for overactive thyroid like you can feel a bit like the <UNIN/> racing of your heart beat and all so I'm not quite clear on what picture we are having here. Yeah?[doctor] I think a general set of bloods is a good <UNIN/> , good start. So what we look at, because you're not, you're not having the umph, aren't you? You're like, you're just <UNIN/> feeling a bit, you know low and things like that, right? Well, um, and weak and things like that. So we'll just do a general set of bloods. <UNIN/> we look at things like anaemia, how your kidney functions are, your livers, all that, with vitamin levels, and your <UNIN/>.[doctor] OK. And uh, now after we get those set of bloods, we will find out if we can find anything in them. If that's all clear, then we would need to do a physical examination. OK?[doctor] We would need to then go in and do <UNIN/>. But there's nothing from what your history you've said that, that we urgently warrant a physical examination at this point in time. I think it's a good idea to start off with a blood test, and then take it from there.[doctor] Obviously with palpitations or chest pain, if you get that's more of a medical emergency. You need to go to A and E for that. OK? If things change, you've mentioned now your bowels are fine, and you're not being sick. So if that's the case it's OK, but if your, you know, bowels change or you're being sick again, you need to get in touch with us. OK? <UNIN/>[doctor] Sorry? Could you repeat that?[doctor] Mm-hmm.[doctor] OK. So let's do all the blood tests first and we'll take it from there. OK? But you know, if you have any chest pains, or change in bowel habits, do get in touch with us.[doctor] OK. Now what we need to do is now you need to ring up support. And I'll <UNIN/> the form for you, but in the interim you need to call support so that we can organise that blood test for you. And when you get the result, you will receive a text message through your phone to tell you to book an appointment. <UNIN/> If you're feeling poorly, don't wait for that. Just get in touch with us again, yeah?[doctor] Ohh, there's a number on your app, yeah? If you open up your app there's the number on there. It's an oh three hundred number, yeah? So just call that number.[doctor] Alright then. You take care. Bye now.[doctor]  Ciao, bye.","S (Subjective):

I haven't had a fever, um, at the moment, but I did notice um a temperature when the symptoms started, so, um, yeah around about three or four days ago.[doctor] Yes.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>[patient] Yeah, I uh I didn't mention my temperature, no, but I felt, um, just a bit hot. And, y'know.[doctor] OK, fine, OK. Um, right, let me just <UNIN/>, write a few notes down as well. Um.[patient] Uh, no.[doctor] <UNIN/>, and you mentioned a tummy pain, that also started a few days ago. Does the pain move anywhere else? Does it move towards the back, or towards your flank, the sides?[patient] Yeah, so um, I vomited at the start of the symptoms but now um I've stopped vomiting.[doctor] No, OK, fine. With those symptoms, have you noticed any other symptoms like nausea, vomiting?[patient] Yeah, yeah, just normal vomit, yeah. No no blood, no. Yeah.[doctor] OK. Any fevers, or temperatures?[patient] Yep. Um, I had a loss of appetite, um, so I haven't been eating as much, but I've been able to hold down fluids.[doctor] <UNIN/>, sorry, was there any, any fevers or temperatures? Sorry, I didn't hear you.[doctor] No fever, OK, fine, sorry. Um, OK. Um, in terms of your bowel, are your bowels working OK?[patient] Yep.[doctor] So, uh, by that I mean, um, any, any diarrhoea, loose stool?[patient] Um, just soups, and, uh, yeah, light foods. Like smoothies and, yeah, liquid foods mainly.[doctor] OK, all right. And um, Jessica, sometimes we have to ask very private sensitive questions, uh, just to <UNIN/>, get a full history. Um, hope you don't mind me asking, but are you currently sexually active?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, is that with a regular, partner?[patient] Yeah, so I had takeaway about four days ago, um, uh, but other than that I've, yeah, been, uh, eating normally. Nothing unusual here.[doctor] Fine, OK. Um, have you noticed any other discharge from, from down below?[patient] Um, yeah, I <UNIN/> ate at a Chinese restaurant with friends. Yeah.[doctor] No, OK. When was your last um, uh, last STD screen? If, if ever?[patient] Um, so no one else in the family, so <UNIN/> a wife and two kids and one, um, child was vomiting, but they haven't got diarrhea. There's no one with the same symptoms.[doctor] No, OK, fine. And, and um.[doctor] Do you use any form of contraception, at all?[doctor] You use condoms, OK. And when was your last, period?[patient] Um, yeah, I mean, other than um athsma, um I use an inhaler, everything uh else is fine.[doctor] Three weeks ago, OK. Is there any chance you could be pregnant perhaps?[doctor] Is there <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> any chance you could be pregnant?[patient] Uh, yeah, that's fine. I just, yeah, use an inhaler, and uh that's under control.[doctor] No, no. <UNIN/>, it's always worth asking uh, young females like yourself, um. Uh, um, so if that obviously you are worried about the pain.[patient] No.[doctor] Um, not getting any better, uh, then I'd always <UNIN/>, advise getting a pregnancy test, to rule out pregnancy. OK? Um, fine. So just moving on, moving on. Are you otherwise fit and well?[patient] Uh, no, no other medications.[patient] Yeah.[patient] Uh, so, I need to stay close to the toilet 'cause I go quite frequently during the these past three days. Um, yeah, other than that, it's uh, yeah, the main concern.[doctor] And so by that I mean, do you have any other medical problems, medical <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, medical history?[patient] Uh, yes, yeah. I I work, er. Um, I'm an accountant.[doctor] OK. Do you take any regular medications?[patient] Uh, yeah, I've been going to work. Yeah. Yeah, it's been quite difficult.[patient] Yes, yeah.[doctor] OK. So you've tried that and it didn't help? OK, all right. Um, do you have any allergies to any medications?[patient] Uh, no, I don't smoke.[patient] Uh, no, I I don't drink alcohol, no. <UNIN/>[doctor] And what happens when you take Clindamycin?[doctor] Right then, OK. So it's quite a, seems like a quite severe allergy to it, is <UNIN/>, is that right? Um, OK. Fine. In terms of your family history, is there anything I should be aware of, um, related to kidneys, bladder, bowels, guts?[patient] Yeah.[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] OK, all right. And tell me a bit more about your home situation. Who's lives, who's at home with you?[patient] Okay.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, and what <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] OK, and are you a, are you working at the moment, or are you a student?[doctor] OK, and what are you studying?[patient] <UNIN/>[doctor] And how's that going?[patient] Mm-hmm.[doctor] <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> great. Do you have any aspirations for the future, in terms of careers?[patient] Okay.[doctor] <UNIN/>, recommend it, we need doctors. Um, what about smoking and alcohol? Do you drink much in the way of, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>, do you, do you smoke, or do you drink much in the way of alcohol?[patient] Yep.[patient] Yep.[doctor] <UNIN/>, so socially, OK. All right. Um, right, excellent. So, um, at this stage I <UNIN/>, I would proceed to examination.[patient] Okay.[patient] Yeah.[doctor] But um, based on your story, um, just to summarise really. So, last three days, you've been having bit of burning pain on passing urine. A bit of, crampy tummy pain lower down.[patient] Okay, sure.[doctor] Um, <UNIN/>, essentially but, but no other fevers or back pain, uh, if I, if I understand correctly.[patient] Yep.[doctor] I think probably do have what we call a simple UTI or urinary tract infection, bladder infection, um, which can be readily treated. So, I'll give you a course of antibiotics today.[patient] <UNIN/>[patient] Yep, sure, yep.[patient] That sounds great, yeah. Yeah.[patient] Um, no, no further questions, no.[doctor] Something, called either Nitrofurantoin, or Trimethoprim. Uh, and it's normally a three day course. Uh, so, one tablet, twice a day, for three days.[patient] Uh, yes, yeah, that's that's very clear. Thank you.[patient] Okay, thank you. Bye.[doctor] And <UNIN/>, that should hopefully help your symptoms, but I also advise you to drink plenty of fluids. Let's try and flush that, you know, that infection out of your body, if you can.[doctor] Um, you can try, cranberry juice, that can sometimes help with your symptoms.[doctor] Um, and if you're still not better, by the end of this week, I want you to give me a call or come back and see me. And uh, we can have another look at your symptoms.[doctor] OK.[doctor] Yeah, yeah absolutely. And things to look out for would be, you know, if you are having kind of, high temperatures, a back pain, um just <UNIN/>, generally feeling more unwell.[doctor] Uh, you know, I do want you give me a call back, 'cause then we do worry whether your infection may be spreading up towards your kidneys, which is something we wanna avoid. So, do, do give me a call if you're having any concerns, OK.[doctor] Yeah I mean if you can try and avoid it, I think that'd be sensible. Um, uh, <INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/> it's great that you're using barrier contraception. I would recommend you to continue using barrier contraception, but if you can avoid it while your symptoms clear up. That'd probably be the best for you and your boyfriend,<INAUDIBLE_SPEECH/>.[doctor] All right.[doctor] Great.[doctor] Thank you very much.
